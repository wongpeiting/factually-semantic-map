2025-11-15,Corrections regarding false statements concerning the treatment of Pannir Selvam A/L Pranthaman,MalaysiaNow had communicated falsehoods concerning the treatment of Pannir Selvam A/L Pranthaman,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/151125/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/bdbc9235-5821-4e35-afcb-65f44aa30a81/pofma banner.png,"The Ministry of Home Affairs ('
MHA
') is aware of an article published by MalaysiaNow on 9 November 2025 that contains false statements concerning the treatment of Pannir Selvam A/L Pranthaman ('
Pannir
').
The article makes the following false statements:
Pannir's execution was carried out without regard for the rule of law.
The Government's decision not to issue a certificate of substantive assistance to Pannir was unlawful.
The Central Narcotics Bureau ('
CNB
') secretly facilitated an interview of Pannir by the Malaysian police.
At the interview, a CNB officer wore a Malaysia police (PDRM) uniform and deliberately hid his identity as a CNB officer.
The Singapore Prison Service ('
SPS
') officers attempted to mislead Pannir's family into signing a form stating that all of Pannir's belongings had been handed over to them.
Facts:
All Prisoners Awaiting Capital Punishment ('PACP') are afforded due legal process
An execution will only be scheduled when a PACP has exhausted all legal processes in relation to his conviction and sentence, and after the issue of clemency has been dealt with. This is the case for all PACPs, including Pannir. The facts of his case are as follows.
On 3 September 2014, Pannir was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint where he was found to be in possession of one packet of granular/powdery substance in the back seat compartment of his motorcycle and three packets of similar substance concealed at his groin area.
On 2 May 2017, the High Court convicted and sentenced him to death for importing into Singapore, not less than 51.84 grammes of diamorphine, or pure heroin, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 620 abusers for a week. On 9 February 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against his conviction and sentence. He was accorded full due process under the law and represented by legal counsel throughout the trial and appeal.
Following the dismissal of his appeal, Pannir was involved in 11 post-appeal applications between 2019 and 2025, seven of which were joint applications with other PACPs. All of these applications had concluded by the time of his execution, with the last application dismissed on 7 October 2025.
Six petitions for clemency were submitted to the President on his behalf, all of which were rejected.
Pannir was first scheduled for execution on 24 May 2019. The execution was stayed because of a last-minute application that he filed to challenge the rejection of his clemency petition. This was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 26 November 2021. Pannir was scheduled for execution a second time on 20 February 2025. He was granted a stay of execution to make another application against his capital sentence. The application was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 5 September 2025.
It is therefore false and misleading to suggest that the execution of Pannir on 8 October 2025 was carried out without regard for the rule of law. Pannir was accorded full due process under the law, and was scheduled for execution after he had exhausted all legal processes (including the clemency process) in relation to his conviction and sentence.
Pannir was not issued a Certificate of Substantive Assistance ('CSA') as he had not provided substantive assistance to CNB 
Under the law, a person facing a capital charge of drug trafficking or importation may be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty, if the following requirements are met: (a) his involvement is limited to that of being a courier (as defined in section 33B(2)(
a
) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 ('
MDA
')); and (b) the Public Prosecutor has issued a CSA to certify to the court that, in his or her determination, the person has substantively assisted CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.
Under section 33B(4) of the MDA, the determination of whether any person has substantively assisted CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities is at the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor.
Pannir was not issued a CSA as the Public Prosecutor determined that he had not provided substantive assistance to CNB. Pannir's legal challenge against the Public Prosecutor's decision not to issue a CSA was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 26 November 2021.
Contrary to what is stated, Pannir did not provide information that led to the arrest of Zamri Tahir. CNB arrested Zamri Tahir based on information that it already had.
Allegations against CNB and SPS's treatment of Pannir are false 
On 27 September 2025, CNB facilitated an interview between the Malaysian Narcotics Crime Investigation Department ('
NCID
') and Pannir, pursuant to a formal request by NCID. CNB works closely with our overseas counterparts and will facilitate requests, where possible. The interview process was open and aboveboard ' SPS had notified Pannir of the interview request. Pannir did not object to being interviewed, nor did he request for his lawyer to be present. Pannir was also not prohibited from consulting his family or his counsel.
The NCID officers interviewed Pannir in the presence of a CNB officer, who was not wearing a Malaysian police uniform or posing as a Malaysian police officer. Thus, contrary to what is alleged, Pannir's counsel was not 'excluded', and the officers' identities were not concealed.
Separately, prior to his execution, Pannir requested to hand over his handwritten letters and poems to his family. SPS reviewed these items and assessed that the content of a few pages affected the security or good order of the prison. These pages were therefore withheld by SPS, as permitted under the law.
After Pannir's execution, SPS officers met with Pannir's family to hand over Pannir's belongings and requested for them to sign a form acknowledging that the items indicated on the form were returned to them. Pannir's family then claimed that some pages of Pannir's documents were missing. The officers informed them that the documents were screened in accordance with SPS's screening guidelines and that pages which did not meet the guidelines were withheld. Eventually, Pannir's family took over Pannir's belongings without signing the form.
At no point did SPS attempt to mislead Pannir's family into signing a form stating that all of his belongings were returned to them.

2025-09-22,Corrections regarding false statements of fact made by Mr Nicholas Tan and Aupen,"Mr Nicholas Tan communicated multiple false statements of fact on his Instagram account on 9, 15 and 16 September 2025; and a false statement of fact was communicated on Aupen's Instagram account on 15 September 2025",Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/220925/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/89fbabef-afce-4989-b592-3be9e4088474/Factually-Corrections regarding false statements of fact.jpg,"On 9, 15 and 16 September 2025, Mr Tan published a series of false statements on Mr Tan's interactions with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and its wholly owned subsidiary, IPOS International Pte Ltd (collectively '
IPOS
'), and Singapore's trade mark laws. These falsehoods were communicated by way of Instagram Stories and Instagram posts (collectively the '
Publications
') through his personal Instagram account (@nicktandurian). One of the falsehoods was also communicated on Aupen's official Instagram account (@aupenofficial). Aupen is a Singapore-registered business founded by Mr Tan.
At the relevant time, Aupen faced a potential challenge by United States ('
U.S.
') retailer Target, against a trade mark application in the U.S. by Aupen ('
Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute
').
The Publications communicated the following falsehoods:
IPOS told Mr Tan not to pursue a trade mark dispute with Target in Singapore, as there was a high chance of losing;
Singapore's trade mark laws are designed to protect foreign businesses and not local businesses;
IPOS told Mr Tan that legal reform to disallow bad faith trade mark registrations in Singapore would not be possible;
IPOS provides support to foreign companies, and not local companies, in their trade mark disputes; and
In IPOS's media statement dated 11 September 2025, IPOS flip-flopped on its advice to Mr Tan.
The falsehoods in the Publications risk undermining public confidence in the strength of Singapore's trade mark regime and the impartiality of IPOS as the administrator of the regime and the Registry of Trade Marks. Further, the falsehoods give the damaging and misleading impression that local businesses should not stand up for their intellectual property rights against foreign businesses.
Facts
A. IPOS did not tell Mr Tan not to pursue a trade mark dispute with Target in Singapore or that he had a high chance of losing in such a dispute.
In 2018, Target registered its 'AUDEN' trade mark in the U.S. and in Singapore, for different categories of products.
In 2023, Aupen applied to register its 'AUPEN' trade mark in Singapore and the U.S. The 'AUPEN' trade mark was successfully registered in Singapore in 2023 and remains valid. No challenge to the trade mark has been filed in Singapore.
On 25 August 2025, Aupen's official Instagram account (@aupenofficial) carried a post about Target relaunching its 'AUDEN' line of goods in 2024 and selling bags that were similar to those sold by Aupen. The Instagram post also showed a letter from Target to Aupen in which Target stated that its customers in the U.S. might be confused by the 'AUPEN' trade mark given the similarities with Target's 'AUDEN' trade mark, and sought information on Aupen's current and intended use of the 'AUPEN' trade mark.
Rights conferred by the registration of a trade mark only apply in the country where the trade mark is registered. If Target proceeds to object to Aupen's trade mark application for 'AUPEN' in the U.S., the matter will be heard in the U.S.
The Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute between Aupen and Target in the U.S. has and will have no effect on Aupen's trade mark registration in Singapore, which remains valid, unless and until there is a successful challenge in Singapore, whether by Target or any other party.
Upon learning from its 25 August 2025 Instagram post that Aupen, a Singapore business with a Singapore-registered trade mark, was involved in the Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute, IPOS initiated a meeting to offer support. For example, Singapore citizens and permanent residents and Singapore-registered businesses who face potential IP issues may be referred to the IP Legal Clinic, which connects them with experienced IP lawyers.
This meeting took place on 1 September 2025.
At the meeting, Mr Tan shared more information about the Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute, including that he was receiving legal advice regarding it
1
. As for Aupen's 'AUPEN' trade mark in Singapore, IPOS reassured Mr Tan that it remained valid.
Going beyond protecting Aupen's trade mark in Singapore, Mr Tan asked about counter-actions, including revoking Target's trade marks in Singapore. In accordance with its standard practice, IPOS provided general information and considerations, but did not provide any legal advice. Instead, IPOS encouraged Mr Tan to seek independent legal advice to understand the options, risks and associated costs. IPOS did not at any time advise Mr Tan against pursuing a trade mark dispute with Target, nor did they advise on his chances of succeeding in such a dispute. IPOS does not provide legal advice on potential disputes, for which businesses should engage independent legal counsel.
B. Singapore's trade mark laws are intended to ensure equal and fair access for all businesses seeking trade mark protection in Singapore.
As the national IP authority, IPOS's functions include administering the systems in Singapore for the protection of IP rights and promoting public awareness and effective use of IP rights. IPOS is committed to administering an IP regime that is robust, transparent and neutral. It is neither in the mandate of our IP regime, which is globally recognised, nor in IPOS's interest to prioritise any particular business over another in any dispute between them.
Singapore's IP laws seek to ensure equal and fair access for all businesses seeking IP protection in Singapore. In line with this, Singapore's trade mark registration regime does not differentiate between foreign and local businesses. Any business, whether foreign or local, may register their trade marks at IPOS before commencing trade in Singapore. All applications for registration undergo the same examination process at IPOS to ensure that the application meets the statutory criteria for registration.
2
Far from preferring foreign businesses over local businesses, IPOS works actively to promote IP protection for Singapore businesses to help them grow and expand globally, including launching the GoBusiness IP Grow platform in 2023 and offering complimentary consultations with IP strategists to help businesses understand and manage their intangible assets. More information can be found at:
ipos.gov.sg/manage-ip/resources/for-enterprises.
C. IPOS did not tell Mr Tan that legal reform to disallow bad faith trade mark registrations in Singapore would not be possible.
At the 1 September meeting, Mr Tan expressed concerns about foreign businesses that had registered trade marks in Singapore despite not operating here. Mr Tan also asked how he could lobby for a change in Singapore's law.
In line with its usual approach to such feedback, IPOS informed Mr Tan that he could write to IPOS with his views, and that any legislative change would take time. IPOS did not tell Mr Tan that legal reform would not be possible, be it legal reform with respect to bad faith trade mark registration or legal reform in general.
In fact, Singapore's trade mark laws already prohibit the registration of trade marks made in bad faith. Registrations made in bad faith include those which were dishonestly made, or are considered to be commercially unacceptable by industry.
D. In trade mark disputes before IPOS, IPOS treats all parties equally and fairly.
IPOS conducts hearings for certain disputes involving the registration of trade marks
in Singapore
, depending on the legal issues raised. In this role, IPOS also does not intervene on behalf of any party and treats all businesses in a neutral manner regardless of their country of origin.
3
Further, as part of enterprise engagement, IPOS supports local businesses by helping them navigate IP challenges and opportunities, and connecting them with service providers such as IP lawyers and IP management consultants.
4
E. IPOS's Media Statement sets out what IPOS communicated to Mr Tan regarding the Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute.
On 11 September 2025, IPOS issued a Media Statement
5
addressing false and misleading statements reported in various media outlets regarding the 1 September meeting and as posted by Mr Tan on 9 September 2025 on his social media account. IPOS's Media Statement reflects what IPOS conveyed to Mr Tan at the 1 September meeting. IPOS's Media Statement clarified that IPOS did not advise Mr Tan against pursuing a trade mark dispute with Target or that he had a high chance of losing in such a dispute. The Media Statement also clarified that IPOS did not tell Mr Tan that allowing Target to register its trade marks in Singapore, even though it does not operate here was in line with the mandate to make Singapore attractive for foreign investment.
Instead of clarifying the falsehoods thereafter, Mr Tan made his 16 September social media post insinuating that IPOS flip-flopped on its advice to Mr Tan. The insinuation is that IPOS's Media Statement is false or inaccurate and that Mr Tan's account is true.
The facts of the discussion with Mr Tan are covered above at paragraphs 12, 13, 17 and 18.  The fact is that Mr Tan already sought legal advice for the Potential U.S. Trade Mark Dispute. While IPOS does offer help to Singapore businesses to navigate IP challenges and opportunities, as a neutral agency IPOS did not encourage or discourage Mr Tan on any action that he wished to take with regard to any potential dispute.
F. Conclusion
Mr Tan's posts not only have the effect of attracting publicity for himself and Aupen, but they also denigrate IPOS's impartiality and neutrality, as well as the integrity of IPOS and its officers. Unless corrected, these falsehoods will erode the public's trust in IPOS, our IP laws and our public institutions in general.
The Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ('
POFMA
') Office to issue Correction Directions to Mr Tan and Aupen in respect of their posts, which have been removed. The Correction Directions require the recipients to put up a new post with a link to the Government's clarification.

Mr Jay Ish'haq Rajoo ('
Mr Jay
') published a TikTok post in video format on 26 August 2025 regarding the Government's support for the Chinese Community Leadership Course. There are false statements of fact contained within Mr Jay's post.
2.     These false statements of fact are:
a.     Minister Chee Hong Tat had announced that the Government will be providing money and resources to attract mainland Chinese to Singapore, and nurture them for leadership positions.
b.     The Government is using its money and resources to nurture leaders only from the Chinese race.
3.     The false statements of fact contained in Mr Jay's post are serious. Of note, they are likely to result in a diminution of public confidence in the Government's commitment to serve the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.
Facts
4.     The Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations ('
SFCCA
') and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry ('
SCCCI
') are working together to develop a leadership course to nurture the next generation of Singaporean community leaders (the
'
Initiative
') recommended by the SFCCA and SCCCI. Minister Chee Hong Tat had announced the Government's intended support of the Initiative, which will include providing funding and assistance in programme design.
a.   
Only Singapore citizens who are active in the community and have demonstrated a passion to serve are eligible for the Chinese Community Leadership Course.
b.     Citizens from other countries will not be eligible for the said course.
c.     SFCCA and SCCCI will manage the selection of participants, who will be nominated by local Chinese clans and business groups.
d.     The programme seeks to hone participants' ability to effectively lead community organisations, while deepening their understanding of Singapore's unique multiracial and multicultural context.
5.   
The Initiative is part of the larger movement to groom young leaders of all races in Singapore, and strengthen the leadership pipeline in our community organisations
.
a.     The National Youth Council runs the Our Singapore Leadership Programme to develop young leaders, which is open to youths from all races and backgrounds. Similarly, Youth Corps Singapore also nurtures youths to serve and lead in their communities.
b.     The Government provides funding support to all communities, such as through the self-help groups, to invest in similar leadership development and capacity building programmes. For instance:
i.     Yayasan MENDAKI started the Tunas Bersama M
3
programme in 2022 to nurture the next generation of leaders from Malay/Muslim organisations. The 18-month programme equips emerging leaders with the knowledge, skills and networks to contribute and lead their organisations, and take on leadership roles in the community.
 ii.     The Singapore Indian Development Association Youth Club, through programmes like the SINDA Young Leaders Programme, develops Indian youths to lead with purpose and drive change in their communities and beyond.

There are false statements of fact contained within Mr Obeid's posts.
The false statements of fact contained within these posts are:
The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) required multiple rounds of edits to Mr Obeid's material, including to remove all references to Israel, Palestine, and the conflict in Gaza, but rejected his script even after he complied with all required removals.
IMDA told Mr Obeid they were rejecting his Arts Entertainment Licence (AEL) application, inter alia, because they were wary that Mr Obeid may go off-script on stage.
The false statements of fact contained in Mr Obeid's posts are serious. Of note, they are likely to result in a diminution of public confidence in the Government's handling of the conflict in Gaza and its approach to public discussions about the matter. Furthermore, the false statements of fact contained in Mr Obeid's post are likely to reduce public confidence in IMDA's exercise of its functions in making objective assessments of AEL applications.
Facts
IMDA did not require multiple rounds of edits to Mr Obeid's material, including to remove all references to Israel, Palestine, and the conflict in Gaza, nor did IMDA tell Mr Obeid that they were rejecting his AEL application because they were wary that Mr Obeid may go off-script on stage.
The timeline of events is as follows:
8 Jul 2025: Mr Obeid's personal assistant emailed IMDA to enquire about the AEL application process.
9 Jul 2025: IMDA replied to Mr Obeid's personal assistant with the details of the application process and that the application should rightfully be submitted by a local representative 40 working days before the event is staged, to allow sufficient time for applications to be processed.
15 Aug 2025: IMDA received the AEL application from Mr Obeid's local representative (the '
Applicant
').
19 Aug 2025: IMDA responded to the Applicant, stating that the application was rejected as it far exceeded the deadline for submission (by 30 working days).
20 Aug 2025: IMDA received an appeal from the Applicant.
25 Aug 2025: IMDA replied to the Applicant that the appeal was rejected.
The AEL application was rejected solely because it was late. This was communicated to the Applicant. At no juncture did IMDA discuss the contents of Mr Obeid's script with him or the Applicant. It is therefore impossible that IMDA could have requested for any edits to made to Mr Obeid's script. IMDA also did not tell Mr Obeid or the Applicant that they were rejecting Mr Obeid's AEL application because they were wary that Mr Obeid may go off-script on stage.
Additional Clarifications
On the process for applying for AELs
The IMDA website [
Arts Entertainment Licence
] states that AEL applications are required to be submitted at least
40 working days
before the event. This is intended to allow sufficient time for AEL applications to be processed, or for advisories to be included in publicity materials and advertisements. This timeline for submission is made known publicly and listed on IMDA's website.
IMDA does not require the full script to be submitted for unscripted performances such as stand-up comedies, as it is cognisant that performers may deviate from their script, given the nature of such performances. For such performances, the AEL applicant is required to submit (a) a synopsis, (b) a content checklist which includes relevant information about the performance (such as talking points, rehearsal videos, or videos of past performances), and (c) any multimedia material that may be used during the event.
On the Government's approach to arts entertainment performances and films
The Government does not disallow content for arts entertainment performances just because it touches on the Israel-Palestine conflict. IMDA assesses content according to publicly available guidelines, such as the
Arts Entertainment Classification Code
(for Arts Entertainment events) and
Film Classification Guidelines
(for films). Only content that infringes these guidelines will be refused classification.
There have been past instances where films and arts entertainment events regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict have been allowed. IMDA has also allowed individuals who have been vocal about their views regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict to perform in Singapore.

2025-05-20,"What are CPF monies invested in, and how are CPF interest rates determined?",Your CPF savings are invested by the CPF Board in Special Singapore Government Securities.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/how-cpf-monies-are-invested/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/a6368c87-2b15-4b21-aad0-cc48e0604f0d/cpfbuildingjurong.jpg,"What are CPF monies invested in, and how are CPF interest rates determined?
1) What are CPF monies invested in?
CPF savings are invested by the CPF Board in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS), which are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government.
The proceeds from SSGS are pooled together with other sources of Government funds, such as Government surpluses and land sales receipts. GIC, as the Government's fund manager, receives funds from the Government and manages them on a consolidated basis, taking calculated risks aimed at achieving good, long-term returns.
The returns from these SSGS match the interest rates on CPF savings. This means that CPF members will receive the interest rates as announced on their CPF savings, regardless of whether the investment market is performing poorly. This is guaranteed as the Singapore Government is one of the highest credit-rated (triple-A) governments in the world.
2) How are CPF interest rates determined?
The interest rates earned by CPF savings are risk-free and pegged to the returns on
market instruments of comparable risk and duration
. In addition, the Government provides floor rates on CPF interest (2.5% per annum for OA and 4% per annum for SA/MA/RA), as well as extra interest of up to 2% per annum. As a result, currently CPF members aged 55 and above can earn a risk-free rate of up to 6% per annum on their CPF savings, while those below 55 can earn up to 5% per annum.
When the pegged rates exceed the floor rates, CPF savings will correspondingly earn higher interest rates. When market interest rates are low, the Government continues to pay the floor rates. This arrangement protects CPF members against investment risk, particularly the risk of negative returns, and ensures CPF savings are safe even when the market performs poorly.
To help boost retirement savings, the Government pays Extra Interest on the CPF Balances of members. The extra interest is structured so that all CPF members benefit, and members with lower balances benefit more.
3) Why are CPF interest rates not pegged to GIC's investment returns?
Pegging CPF interest rates to GIC's returns would subject CPF members to investment market risks. This means that the interest that would be paid on members' CPF savings would fluctuate depending on market conditions and as a result be more uncertain. In a very bad investment market, it might even be negative.
Instead of pegging CPF interest to GIC's returns, the Government protects CPF members from bearing any investment risk, and provides them with certainty over the interest rate paid on their CPF savings regardless of market conditions.
In years when investment returns are poor, the Government's buffer of net assets helps to absorb any losses and ensures that the Government can meet its obligations on the SSGS. These net assets are in turn built up in years of good investment returns.
4) What does the Government use the monies from SSGS for?
The Government manages the monies from SSGS on a commingled basis and invests through GIC to ensure that it is able to consistently meet its long-term obligations, including SSGS interest payments and redemptions.
GIC therefore manages the monies with the aim of earning good returns on a long-term basis.
5) How can CPF members get higher returns on their CPF monies?
CPF members can consider transferring their Ordinary Account savings to their Special or Retirement Account for higher returns of up to 5% and 6% per annum
1
respectively,
to eventually enjoy higher retirement payouts.
For CPF members who are prepared to take on more risk to grow their CPF savings on their own for potentially higher returns, the
CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS)
offers members the option to invest part of their CPF savings in a range of financial products, such as shares, unit trusts, government bonds, and treasury bills, allowing members to tailor their investment strategy to their risk appetite.
The CPF Board has also been making enhancements to the CPFIS over the past two decades. This includes raising the quality of funds offered, reducing the cost of investing and most recently, bringing in more low-cost funds.
It is important to note that all investments are subject to risks, including potential loss of capital due to market fluctuations. Understanding these risks would help members select investments that are aligned with their investment goals, risk tolerance, and personal circumstances.

6) Do CPF members continue to earn interest when they join CPF LIFE?
The interest earned by CPF members on their CPF savings will be credited to their CPF accounts.
When members join CPF LIFE, their premium will be deducted from their Retirement Account. The interest earned on these premiums will continue to accrue and is factored into their monthly payouts, enabling them to receive higher payouts right from the start.
With risk-pooling, the interest on the remaining premium upon a member's passing is pooled and go towards the monthly payouts of surviving CPF LIFE members. This is key to ensuring that CPF LIFE remains sustainable, enabling members to continue receiving lifelong payouts, even after their own premium and interest have been used up.  No one is able to accurately predict how long they will live, so every member has a chance of outliving their savings and tapping on the pooled interest to sustain their payouts.

: Singapore's electricity prices are one of the highest in the world.
Fact
: Benchmarking studies regularly commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) show that our regulated electricity tariff for households is comparable to that of similar cities around the world. As seen in the infographic below, our tariffs are not the highest. 
Around 95% of Singapore's electricity needs are currently met by imported natural gas. This means that our electricity prices are affected by global energy market volatility.
Other cities may have access to their own sources of fuel for their electricity, which could result in lower costs. These may include renewable energy sources, or coal. However, coal, for instance, may be cheaper but more pollutive.
The graphic below shows data from a benchmarking study commissioned by EMA, based on data from up to 2023.
Why don't we subsidise the price of electricity?
We do not subsidise electricity prices because:
Subsidies benefit those who use more electricity; and
Subsidies are not sustainable in the long run, given that fuel is imported and subject to global pricing.
Instead, our approach has been to right-price electricity to encourage responsible usage. We also seek to keep electricity prices fair and reasonable through regulation and market competition.
Is anything being done to help Singaporeans cope with their electricity bills?
U-Save rebates are provided to Singaporean HDB households to offset their utility expenses. Please refer to the
MOF website
for the latest information regarding U-Save rebates.
Eligible households will also receive climate vouchers through the Climate-Friendly Households Programme (CFHP). This programme will help households in Singapore become more energy- and water-efficient, while saving on utility bills in the long-run. Please refer to the
NEA website
for the latest information regarding CFHP.

2025-04-14,Impact of Foreign Professionals on our Economy and Society,Foreign professionals in Singapore and their impact on our economy and society.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/impact-of-foreign-professionals-on-our-economy-and-society/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/56c33a87-b476-4a3b-b947-60518e9a36e8/banner image - impact of foreign works on our economy and society.jpeg,"Foreign professionals help Singapore compete on the global stage
Maintaining Singapore's global competitiveness is essential to grow the economic pie and create good jobs to improve the standards of living for Singaporeans. To thrive in today's economy, businesses need diverse talent. Even larger economies like the United States and the United Kingdom need foreign talent for their expertise and networks. For Singapore to stay globally competitive, with a smaller workforce, it is crucial to tap on foreign talent to complement our local workforce.
Here are some facts on foreign professionals in Singapore and their impact on our economy and society:
Fact 1: Global talent helps to anchor foreign-owned firms which in turn create employment opportunities and high-paying jobs for Singaporeans
Access to global talent attracts foreign investments and multinational corporations (MNCs) that create a large number of good jobs for Singaporeans.
While foreign-owned firms make up around 20% of firms, they employ one-third of the resident workforce. About 60% of residents earning more than $13,000 monthly, or the top 10% of residents' income, are employed in foreign-owned firms.
Foreign firms also create business for local firms, who in turn create jobs for Singaporeans.
Fact 2: Singaporeans have benefited from an expanding labour market
Singaporeans in higher-skilled Professional, Managerial, Executive and Technician (PMET) jobs have grown in tandem with an increase in the number of foreign PMETs
In the last 10 years, the number of residents holding PMET jobs increased by 382,000, while the number of Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders increased by 38,000.
In growth sectors such as
Financial & Insurance Services
,
Professional Services
, and
Information, Communications and Technology
, EP and S Pass holders increased by 17,000, while resident PMET employment increased by 172,000.
Singapore citizens made up 86% of the growth in resident PMET jobs (or 328,000) over the same period, in line with their share in our resident labour force.
In addition, Singaporeans have one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest labour force participation rates compared to other developed countries. The income growth of Singaporeans is also higher than that of developed countries, many of which saw their income stagnate or decline.
Fact 3: Foreigners contribute to raising Singaporeans' living standards while reducing our tax burden
Global companies and foreigners pay corporate and personal income taxes which provide a source of revenue to support our social needs, which is increasingly important as the resident population ages.
For example, in 2014, there were 6 resident adults aged 20 to 64 supporting one elderly resident aged 65 and over. This is our 'old-age support ratio'.
Without foreign workers, this ratio would have halved to 3.5 in 2024. This would have meant higher taxes or lower support for our seniors.
By including foreign workers, we have maintained this ratio at 5.2 in 2024. This helps to ease some of the fiscal pressures of our ageing population.
Real Challenges, Real Solutions
An open and competitive economy has delivered positive social and economic benefits to Singapore, but is not without its challenges. The Government proactively addresses them through its policies.
Upholding quality of Employment Pass (EP) holders
We maintain a high quality bar for foreign professionals to ensure that they complement our workforce.
EP qualifying salaries are benchmarked to the top one-third of local PMET salaries. This ensures quality and that foreigners are not hired simply because they are willing to accept lower wages.
EP applications are also assessed through MOM's Complementarity Assessment (COMPASS), which helps to ensure that EP applicants are well-qualified and possess verified credentials from accredited institutions.
Ensuring that employers diversify their labour sources and support local employment
Under COMPASS, employers are assessed on the nationality diversity of their workforce and their support for local employment.
Firms that do not hire locals or have an over-reliance on foreigners from a single nationality will find it more difficult to pass COMPASS.
COMPASS has been effective. Since its introduction in 2023, the share of firms with higher dependence on foreigners of a single nationality has decreased by 7%, while the share of firms with higher dependence on foreigners generally has decreased by 15%. These firms also created 4,000 more PMET jobs for locals.
Taking action against employers that discriminate against Singaporeans
MOM does not tolerate unfair employment practices, such as nationality-based discrimination.
The Workplace Fairness Legislation better protects Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
MOM has implemented checks to ensure that employers adopt fair and merit-based employment practices.
Over the last 5 years, over 600 Employment Pass applications were withdrawn or rejected following investigations.
Individuals who believe that they have been unfairly treated can seek redress by contacting the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) at
https://www.tal.sg/tafep/contact-us
.
Empowering Singaporeans to stay competitive
The Government has invested significantly in Singaporeans to stay competitive and secure good jobs, spending over $10 billion over the last five years on local workforce initiatives, which include:
WSG's Career Conversion Programmes
provide salary support of up to 90% for workers to move into new job roles or sectors that have good prospects and opportunities for progression.
SSG's SkillsFuture Level-up Programme
supports mid-career Singaporeans aged 40 years and above to pursue a substantive skills reboot. It includes a SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance of up to $3,000 per month to support long-form training.
SkillsFuture Credits
further offset out-of-pocket course fees for SkillsFuture-approved courses. Those aged 40 years and above will receive a top-up of $4,000 to further support their upskilling needs.
Career Health SG
. The Government empowers Singaporeans to take charge of their careers and navigate changes in the industry and economy, by supporting career guidance and tools to help workers optimise their careers, like the CareersFinder feature on WSG's MyCareersFuture job portal.
Local leadership programmes.
To groom local leaders, the Government has a suite of leadership development programmes, including overseas immersion and leadership milestone programmes.
Integrating foreigners with Singaporeans
Foreign professionals live and work among us, and we must foster an environment where our foreign and local workforce mutually understand and appreciate each other's social and cultural norms. By enabling meaningful interactions and friendships between locals and foreigners both at the workplace and in the community, we can strengthen mutual respect and build a more cohesive society.
The Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth (MCCY), Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and Singapore Business Federation (SBF) have convened an Alliance for Action (AfA) on the Integration of Foreign Professionals to explore ways to better integrate foreign professionals into the workplace and community.
The Government is open and transparent about labour market statistics
MOM publishes a Labour Market Report as well as a Labour Market Advance Release every quarter, and releases numerous datasets on job vacancies, unemployment and income. The data can be found at
http://stats.mom.gov.sg
.
Labour force statistics are based on the resident population. This is aligned with international practice. In addition, resident data typically mirrors citizen data, and having citizen data provides little additional information. For more details, please see

Government revenue comes from taxes, fees & charges collected by Government agencies and Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC).
Taxes
More than 70% of our revenue comes from taxes. Taxes in Singapore are primarily on income, consumption and wealth. 
a) Income
taxes include Corporate Income Tax (CIT), Personal Income Tax (PIT) and Withholding Tax.
b) Consumption taxes include Goods and Services Tax (GST) as well as customs and excise duties. 
c) Wealth
taxes such as Property Tax and Buyer's Stamp Duty, as well as the Additional Registration Fee, which is part of our Motor Vehicle Taxes.
d) Other taxes include Foreign Worker Levy, Water Conservation Tax, Land Betterment Charge and Annual Tonnage Tax.
Fees and Charges
Fees and Charges (F&Cs)
are charges for goods and services provided by the Government. This is to ensure that users of such goods and services pay, to discourage overconsumption and so that non-users do not have to subsidise them. F&C rates are priced to allow the Government to cost recover and make the provision of the goods or services sustainable. Examples of F&Cs include parking charges for carparks maintained by HDB and URA, and licence fees such as driving licences.
Net Investment Returns Contribution
Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC)
comprises:
a) Up to 50% of the Net Investment Returns (NIR) on the net assets invested by GIC, MAS, and Temasek; and
b) Up to 50% of the Net Investment Income (NII) derived from past reserves from the remaining assets.
These investment returns on our reserves provide additional resources for Government spending to benefit Singaporeans. About 20% of Government spending every year is funded by the NIRC. Since FY2020, the NIRC has provided an annual revenue stream of around 3.5% of GDP on average.",1.0877632,5.4360514,2025,6,Finance (Read: CPF & Reserves),No target; Explainer

The $20,000 income exemption threshold means that the first $20,000 of an individual's chargeable income is not taxed. You start paying PIT only when you earn more than $20,000 per year.
Even if you earn more than $20,000 per year, your tax bill is further reduced because of various PIT reliefs, deductions, and rebates available. Examples: Earned Income Relief, CPF Relief, Qualifying Child Relief, 250% tax deduction for qualifying donations, and Parenthood Tax Rebate.
All in, all lower-income and even some middle-income workers pay low or no PIT.

APOs
'):
Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam's ('
Mr Jeyaretnam
') article posted on his website, The Ricebowl Singapore, on 9 March 2025 ('
TRS article
'),
Mr Jeyaretnam's Facebook post of 9 March 2025, and
Mr Jeyaretnam's X post of 9 March 2025.
The falsehoods contained in the said publications are:
APOs have all the powers of regular police officers.
Foreign APOs are employed by the Government and are used to keep the incumbent political party (i.e. the People's Action Party) in power, even to the extent of violating the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and using force in breach of fundamental liberties.
The Government deliberately sets the salaries of APOs at a level that would make the role of an APO less attractive to Singaporeans so as to achieve its real objective of hiring foreign APOs, which is its preference.
Facts:
Powers of APOs
Under section 92(4) of the Police Force Act 2004, the powers of an APO are conferred by the Commissioner of Police. These are set out in Gazette Notification No. 170/2017, titled 'Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Auxiliary Police Officers' ('
Notification
').
As stated in the Notification, APOs do not have all the powers of regular police officers. In particular, APOs do not have the powers of investigation that police officers have under Part IV of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, and the power of arrest of APOs is subject to conditions that are not applicable to police officers.
The powers conferred on APOs may only be exercised by an APO when the APO is on official duty and in the course of performing the duties of an APO.
Employment & regulation of APOs
The Singapore Government does not employ APOs, whether local or foreign. Instead, all APOs are employed by Auxiliary Police Forces ('
APFs
'), which are not part of the Singapore Government. The list of APFs and their respective employers is published in Gazette Notification No. 398/2025, titled 'Auxiliary Police Forces'.
The security services that APFs are permitted to provide are carefully circumscribed by the Singapore Police Force. All APOs are legally obliged to comply with our laws, including the Constitution and those relating to fundamental liberties, in the discharge of their duties. These measures collectively prevent abuse of power by APFs and APOs, and ensure that they serve Singapore's legitimate security needs.
Salaries of APOs & proportion of foreign APOs
The salaries of APOs are independently determined by their respective employers, the APFs, and not the Government. APOs do not belong to any union, fall under any tripartite alliance, or similar organisation, which the Government is part of, and which has an influence on the salaries of APOs.
As at end-January 2025, Singaporeans continue to make up the majority of APOs employed. The proportion of APOs from the new foreign sources (i.e., China, India, Myanmar, Philippines, and Sri Lanka) remains very low, at around 3%.
The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods.
The Minister for Digital Development and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ('
POFMA
') Office to issue a POFMA Correction Direction ('

Facts
The Government's land sales and immigration policies are not used to drive up land prices, including the prices of HDB flats. It is also untrue that the Government is intentionally driving up land prices and prices of HDB flats so as to increase the value of the reserves. These policies are also not used for reserves management purposes.
First, the Government's approach to land management is based on Singapore's planning and development needs, and not to intentionally increase land prices and prices of HDB flats.
Second, the Government's immigration policies are intended to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates on our citizen population, and not to intentionally increase land prices and prices of HDB flats.
Third, the Chief Valuer ('CV') determines the fair market value of land based on established valuation principles, taking into consideration relevant resale transactions on the open market, and other relevant factors such as specific parameters of the site. The CV makes her assessment independently, without influence from the Government.
Additional Clarifications
The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority does not grant Singapore citizenship or Permanent residency on the basis of an individual's wealth or net worth.
Each Singapore citizenship and Permanent residency application is assessed on a broad range of factors, such as the applicant's family ties to Singapore, economic contributions, qualifications, age, family profile and length of residency, to assess the applicant's ability to contribute to Singapore and integrate into our society, as well as the applicant's commitment to sinking roots.
The Government provides housing subsidies to make public housing affordable.
New BTO flats are priced for affordability. The Housing Development Board ('HDB') assesses the market value of comparable resale flats, and applies a significant market discount to bring the prices of new BTO flats to affordable levels for a wide range of Singaporeans. HDB releases the selling prices of BTO flats and recently transacted prices of comparable nearby resale flats. The difference in price between BTO flats and comparable resale flats broadly reflects the housing subsidies.
Housing subsidies have also helped to make housing affordable for Singaporeans. In 2024, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their BTO flats were able to service their monthly mortgage repayments using their CPF, with little to no cash outlay.
State land is protected as part of the reserves. Paying fair market value ('FMV') for State land preserves the value of the reserves. In turn, returns from investing the reserves directly benefit Singaporeans.
When the State disposes of land, it does so at FMV to preserve the value of the reserves. This transaction is effectively a conversion of a physical asset to financial assets.
Likewise, when HDB purchases public housing land from the State, HDB has to pay the State the FMV of the land. The proceeds paid by HDB accrue to past reserves, to preserve the value of the reserves.
The reserves are invested for the benefit of all Singaporeans. Returns from investing the reserves supplement the annual Budget through the Net Investment Returns Contribution ('NIRC') and help to fund public programmes that directly benefit Singaporeans.
If the State were to receive less than FMV for disposals of land (including to HDB), the value of the reserves will be eroded over time. This would result in less NIRC, which contributes to approximately 20% of the annual Budget.
POFMA is used to address falsehoods, not to suppress dissenting views.
The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 ('POFMA') is not used to silence those who raise their views on the rent for 26 Ridout Road, or any issue for that matter. Members of the public are encouraged to read up about POFMA at
https://www.pofmaoffice.gov.sg/resources/
.
The Government issues a POFMA Correction Direction ('CD') when a false statement of fact has been communicated, and if it is in the public interest to do so.
It should be emphasised that a CD does not require the recipient to remove the original post. What it requires is for the government's clarification to be carried alongside the original post. Readers can still read the post containing the falsehoods, and also see the government's clarification, to come to their own conclusion. Indeed, nearly all of the posts for which Mr Jeyaretnam was issued a CD continue to be on his website and social media accounts, and remain available for the public to read.
POFMA also provides for a mechanism to warn the public that a communicator has a history of putting up falsehoods. Mr Jeyaretnam has been issued 9 CDs since July 2023, and his website and social media pages have been declared as Declared Online Locations ('DOL') from 12 December 2023 to 11 December 2025 (the 'Declaration'). While the Declaration is in effect, Mr Jeyaretnam's website, as well as his accounts on Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn, are each required to carry a notice stating that multiple falsehoods had been communicated on these online locations.
Finally, some may not just spread falsehoods, but also do so knowingly, causing harm to the public interest. A tougher stance has to be taken against people who intentionally harm Singapore's interests. It is only if such persons are convicted in a court, following the due process of the law, that they may face penalties set out in POFMA.
Thus, POFMA provides a range of tools to deal with falsehoods, and can
only
be used against falsehoods that harm the public interest.
Mr Jeyaretnam has received multiple POFMA directions due to his attempts to spread falsehoods. Mr Jeyaretnam was invited to assist with investigations into his multiple falsehoods but he had informed the POFMA Office that he was overseas and unable to travel back to Singapore due to a medical condition. Mr Jeyaretnam remains abroad.

That's because the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax on the consumption of goods or services in Singapore. While the goods may have been bought overseas, they will be consumed in Singapore. This is no different from how GST applies to goods imported through other channels e.g. online shopping purchases.
This practice has been in place since 1 April 1994 when GST was first implemented in Singapore. It is consistent with the approach taken by other countries that also have a GST system (also known as Value-Added Tax in some countries).
How much GST relief am I entitled to?

Travellers are granted GST relief on goods imported for their own personal use. The amount of relief is based on the value of goods they bring in and the period that they are away from Singapore. Travellers are required to pay GST on the value of the goods which is in excess of the GST import relief granted to them.

For example, as a traveller, if you have been away from Singapore for a week and purchased S$500 worth of goods meant for personal consumption, you would not need to pay GST since you are eligible for GST import relief of up to S$500 in purchase value. However, if you purchased S$800 worth of goods meant for personal consumption on that week-long trip, you would be required to pay GST on the excess S$300 (i.e. S$800 minus the S$500 for which you are eligible for GST relief).
Who does not qualify for GST relief on goods purchased overseas?
Holders of a work permit, employment pass, student pass, dependent pass or long-term pass issued by the Singapore Government and crew members are not eligible for GST relief on goods purchased overseas.
What about imports of liquors or tobacco?

Duty-free concession and GST relief may be granted for liquor meant for travellers' personal consumption up to prescribed quantities. Please refer to the Singapore Customs website
here
 for more information on duty-free concession and GST import relief.
There is no duty-free concession or GST relief for cigarettes and tobacco products and motor fuel including motor spirits, diesel products and compressed natural gas (CNG) in containers.
What about goods I import by post or air (e.g. goods ordered via online shopping)?
GST import relief is granted on goods imported by post or air, excluding liquors and tobacco, with a total value not exceeding S$400. If the value exceeds S$400, GST is payable on the total value of the shipment. Please refer to the Customs website
here
 for more information on importing by postal or courier service.
From 1 Jan 2023, GST is payable on goods imported via air or post that are valued up to and including the current GST import relief threshold of S$400, through the Overseas Vendor Registration regime. The change will ensure a level playing field for our local businesses to compete effectively. The change also ensures that our GST system remains fair and resilient as the digital economy grows. Please see
Overseas Vendor Registration Regime
 for more information.
If I were to buy a branded bag for S$2,000 while holidaying overseas, and were to start using it during the trip, do I have to pay GST when I bring the bag home? If so, how is the GST computed?
Yes, the bag is subject to payment of GST. If you have been away from Singapore for more than 48 hours, you will be entitled to a GST import relief amount of S$500. Therefore, the amount of GST that you will have to pay is [S$(2,000 ' 500) x prevailing GST rate]. If you have been away from Singapore for less than 48 hours, you will be entitled to a GST import relief amount of S$100. Therefore, the amount of GST that you will have to pay is [S$(2,000 ' 100) x prevailing GST rate].
And if I pay sales tax while shopping overseas but forget to claim my tax rebate, do I still pay GST?
GST is payable whether or not foreign sales taxes were paid.
What if there is no price tag or receipt? What if I say that my overseas friend gave me the item?
All new items, including gifts and items that have been purchased overseas, are subject to GST. If receipts for the items are unavailable, their value will be based on the transaction value of identical or similar goods from the same country of origin or the original price payable for the goods as if they are sold for export to Singapore, inclusive of freight and insurance charges that are incurred for the shipment.
Do I have to pay GST for items which I bought from a second-hand shop when I was overseas?
Although the item may not be brand new, the item is still subject to GST if they are to be brought into Singapore as they were newly purchased or newly acquired overseas. As such, GST is payable if the value of the item exceeds the GST import relief amount granted.
What if I buy a S$1,000 bag from one of the duty-free shops at Changi Airport while on the way out of Singapore. Will I be required to pay GST on the bag when I return to Singapore?
The newly purchased bag is subject to GST if it exceeds the traveller's GST import relief amount.
How are purchases in foreign currencies converted into SGD for tax purposes?
The foreign currencies are converted into Singapore dollars based on the exchange rates listed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) website
here
. For more information on the exchange rates, please refer to the Customs website
here
.
When do I have to declare and pay GST?
You may make an advance declaration and payment of duties and GST not more than three days before your arrival in Singapore through our Customs@SG web application. An e-receipt will be generated for reference and verification purposes if you are stopped for checks. Upon successful payment, and on arrival in Singapore, you may exit the checkpoints and show the e-receipts as proof of payment to the officers if you are stopped for checks. Please visit our Customs website
here
 for more information on the Customs@SG web application.
Alternatively, you may proceed directly to the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office or the Red Channel upon arrival to declare your items. Officers on duty will advise you accordingly before you exit the Red/Green Channels. Please present supporting documents such as invoices or receipts indicating the value of your items. Payment can be made via NETS, CashCard, or credit card.
You may wish to note that failure to make a declaration is an offence under the Customs Act and the GST Act, and offenders be compounded up to S$5,000 or face prosecution in court, depending on the severity of the offence.

The following publications paint a false and misleading picture about the rental of and works carried out at 26 Ridout Road:
a.          The 'The Online Citizen' ('
TOC
') article dated 14 February 2025, reposted on TOC's accounts on Facebook and X; and
b.          The video posted by 'Twenty Two Thirty' on YouTube on 16 February 2025
(collectively, the '
Publications
').
2.      The Publications communicate the following falsehoods:
a.          The Singapore Land Authority ('
SLA
') has given Minister Shanmugam assurances of an extension to the lease of 26 Ridout Road beyond its expiry in 2027;
b.          The Urban Redevelopment Authority ('
URA
') and the Building and Construction Authority ('
BCA
') did not ensure that all their requisite approvals were obtained for the works carried out at 26 Ridout Road; and
c.          Public funds have been used to pay for the earthworks at 26 Ridout Road carried out since 2024.
3.      The Publications have distorted the facts by making baseless assertions and omitted key facts which are publicly available.
Facts
A.      SLA did not assure Minister Shanmugam of a further extension beyond the expiry of the tenancy term in 2027.
4.      Tenancies for residential State properties are granted for 2 or 3-year terms, with a maximum initial agreement of 3+3+3 years (i.e. renewal every 3 years up to a total of 9 years).
5.      SLA typically allows tenancy renewals upon the expiry of any tenancy term, subject to prevailing market conditions, unless:
a.           the government has other plans for the site; or
b.          the tenant has a poor track record (e.g. rent arrears or breaches of tenancy rules).
6.      26 Ridout Road is subject to a Tenancy Agreement of 3+3+3 years commencing in June 2018. The tenancy was renewed for a third 3-year term from June 2024 till June 2027 in line with SLA's prevailing guidelines. 
7.      There has not been any new undisclosed tenancy term, nor has SLA given any assurance to Minister Shanmugam of any extension beyond the expiry of the term in 2027.  The grant of a further renewal will depend on the factors raised in paragraph 5 above.
8.      Further, during the tenancy, SLA generally allows tenants to carry out improvement works on their property. SLA would advise its tenants to consider the remaining timeframe when planning improvements. The decision on whether and when to undertake such works rests with the tenants.
B.      URA and BCA ensured that all their requisite approvals were obtained for the works carried out at 26 Ridout Road.
When URA and/or BCA approval is applicable for works carried out on State properties tenanted by SLA
9.      For State properties tenanted out by SLA, URA's approval is only required for works that:
a.          affect conserved buildings or monuments; or
b.          exceed 10% of the existing Gross Floor Area of the property.
10.      To streamline the planning application process for works carried out on these properties, URA and SLA have in place a set of pre-authorised works that do not require URA's approval and only require SLA's in-principle agreement. SLA's in-principle agreement must be obtained on the proposed works before they can be carried out on the tenanted property. URA issued circulars in
2015
and
2017
to inform the industry about this streamlined process.
11.      Tenants must still obtain clearance from relevant technical agencies, such as BCA, where necessary. One category of works that does not require BCA's approval is '
insignificant building works
' as prescribed under the First Schedule to the Building Control Regulations 2003 ('
BCR
') read with Regulation 3A of the BCR.
12.      The onus is on the Qualified Person
[1]
('
QP
') engaged by the tenant or SLA to obtain the requisite approvals from relevant agencies prior to carrying out the proposed works.
With respect to the works carried out at 26 Ridout Road, all requisite approvals were obtained
13.      For earthworks carried out within the property by the tenant since 2024
:
a.      SLA's in-principle agreement was obtained;
b.      URA's approval was
not
required as such works fell within the scope of pre-authorised works. Nonetheless, the QP engaged by the tenant had sought approval from URA, and URA advised that its approval was not required; and
c.      BCA's approval was obtained.
14.      For the swimming pool installed by the tenant in 2018:
a.           URA's approval was not required since the pool installation was external to and did not affect the conserved building. The fact that URA's approval was not required had already been addressed in the June 2023 Report on the
Review of the Rentals of State Properties at No. 26 and No. 31 Ridout Road
('
Review
Report
').
b.           BCA's approval was not required since the pool installation was considered '
insignificant building works
' under the
First Schedule to the BCR
. This was because the excavation and earth retaining structure works did not exceed a height of 1.5m.
15.      SLA, as landlord, had also carried out structural works, comprising:
a.      repairs to timber floor beams and joists at the main building and timber beams at a linkway in 2018;
b.      replacement of damaged timber members in 2024; and
c.      restoration and replacement of existing doors and windows in 2024/2025
(collectively '
Structural Works
').
16.      For the Structural Works at paragraph 15(a) and 15(b):
a.      URA's approval was obtained in 2024 and 2023 respectively, per conservation guidelines.  While URA's approval was not obtained prior to commencing the Structural Works at paragraph 15(a), SLA's appointed QP subsequently paid a civil penalty that was issued to SLA and obtained URA's approval to retain the works in April 2024.
b.      BCA's approval was obtained in 2018 and 2024 respectively, as the works involved modifications to the structure of the building and were not considered '
insignificant building works
' under the First Schedule to the BCR. Further, as BCA's website displays approvals obtained in the current and preceding calendar year, the absence of older approvals online does not mean that such approvals were not issued.
17.      For the Structural Works at paragraph 15(c), URA's approval was obtained in 2023 (and its validity subsequently extended in 2024), as the works affected the conserved building. BCA's approval was
not
required, as the works were considered insignificant building works under the First Schedule to the BCR.
18.      SLA bore the costs of the Structural Works as part of its obligations as landlord, to ensure that the rented property is in good condition for safe occupancy and to protect the property's heritage value, in line with the relevant conservation and restoration guidelines. SLA's obligation in this regard had been addressed in the Review Report and during the Parliamentary sitting on 3 July 2023.
C.      No public funds were used to pay for the earthworks at 26 Ridout Road carried out since 2024.
19.      The tenant at 26 Ridout Road bore the full costs of the earthworks conducted since 2024, as well as the other improvement works carried out by the tenant. No public funds were used to finance these works.
Conclusion
20.      TOC had previously published false statements of fact regarding the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road. Despite having received a Correction Direction on 18 February 2024 under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 ('
POFMA
') for various falsehoods in relation to these properties, TOC persists in making baseless assertions of impropriety by Minister's, SLA and other public agencies.
21.      Upholding a system of governance with high standards of integrity is an ongoing, collective effort. We urge the public to be discerning, especially of articles from TOC which have previously made unsubstantiated allegations and omitted publicly available facts. Such actions undermine our public institutions.
22.      The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong, has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions to TOC and 'Twenty Two Thirty' in respect of their articles or posts. The Correction Directions require the recipients to insert a notice against the original article or post (or in a specified online location, where the article or post has been removed), with a link to the Government's clarification.

The article was also shared on their social media pages.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/220125/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/fd11229f-0577-4e80-949d-01f82639a8ed/POFMA2201.jpg,"The article published on 14 January 2025 by the East Asia Forum on their website and shared on their social media pages communicates assertions which are false and misleading.
False Statements of Fact
First, the article communicates that the Singapore government misused the resources and time of the Cabinet, Parliament, the police, the Urban Redevelopment Authority ('
URA
'), and the Building and Construction Authority ('
BCA
'), to pursue Senior Minister ('
SM
') Lee Hsien Loong's private agenda against his siblings and turn his family home,
i.e.
38 Oxley Road, into a memorial to his father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and himself.
This is false.
In relation to the police investigations involving SM Lee's siblings:
A Disciplinary Tribunal ('
DT
') and the Court of Three Judges ('
C3J
') held that Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his wife, Mrs Lee Suet Fern,
lied under oath
in disciplinary proceedings which had been commenced against Mrs Lee Suet Fern, for her misconduct as a lawyer.
The C3J and the DT held that Mrs Lee Suet Fern ""
focused primarily on what her husband wanted done
"", and ""
worked together with Mr [Lee Hsien Yang], with a singular purpose, of getting [Mr Lee Kuan Yew] to execute the Last Will quickly
"". [1]
The C3J and the DT held that Mrs Lee Suet Fern and her husband had excluded the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's own long-time lawyer from the process, and had procured the execution of the last will with '
unseemly haste
', overnight within 16 hours. [2]
Mr Lee Kuan Yew ""
ended up signing a document which was in fact not that which he had indicated he wished to sign""
. [3]
The C3J suspended Mrs Lee Suet Fern from practising as a lawyer for 15 months.
The C3J and DT also made the following findings:
The DT found that Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern had presented ""
an elaborate edifice of lies '¦ both on oath '¦ and through their public and other statements, (which were referred to/relied upon during the Disciplinary Proceedings). The Affidavits were contrived to present a false picture. Several of the lies were quite blatant.
""[4]
The C3J also found that Mr Lee Hsien Yang '
was not telling the truth
' in his sworn evidence in the earlier disciplinary proceedings,
[5]
and that Mrs Lee Suet Fern had acted '
with a degree of dishonesty
' in those proceedings and given '
a contrived and ultimately untrue account of her role.
'[6]
Given these findings, police investigations were commenced against Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Mrs Lee Suet Fern for possible perjury. The couple refused to cooperate and left the country.
In relation to 38 Oxley Road:
SM Lee has long recused himself from all discussions on 38 Oxley Road. Since then, he has not been, and is not, involved in the decisions made by the Cabinet or any government agency in relation to 38 Oxley Road.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew was prepared to accept options other than demolition of 38 Oxley Road, provided that suitable arrangements were made to ensure that: (i) the property was refurbished, and kept in a habitable state; and (ii) the family's privacy was protected.[7] Pertinently, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had written a letter to the Cabinet dated 27 December 2011'his last formal communication to the Cabinet on 38 Oxley Road'acknowledging that 38 Oxley Road may be preserved, and stating his views if that were to happen.
In any case, it is apparent from the National Heritage Board's ('
NHB
') statement on 24 October 2024 that no decision has been made yet on 38 Oxley Road. NHB's Preservation of Sites and Monuments Advisory Board will make an independent assessment on the site's eligibility and suitability for preservation, in accordance with section 4(a) of the Preservation of Monuments Act.
Second, the article communicates that the Prosecution prosecuted Mr Pritam Singh ('
Mr Singh
') without basis, in pursuit of motives other than proper enforcement of the law.
The above allegation is
false
.
The conduct of Mr Singh and Mr Muhamad Faisal bin Abdul Manap ('
Mr Faisal
') before the Committee of Privileges ('
COP
') was referred to the Public Prosecutor, under section 21(1)(
c
) of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act ('
P(PIP)A
').
The Prosecution decided to prefer two charges against Mr Singh.
During the trial, the Defence made a submission of 'no case to answer' in respect of Mr Singh's two charges. However, the Court called on Mr Singh to enter his defence on both charges, which confirms that there were grounds for prosecution.
The trial was held in open court, and Mr Singh gave evidence, as did other witnesses. Closing submissions have been made. The Court will render its verdict in due course.
Third, the article communicates that the Prosecution declined, without basis, to prosecute six senior executives of a Singapore-based government-linked company,
i.e.
Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited ('
KOM
'), which had paid US$55 million in bribes.
This is false.
The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau ('
CPIB
'), in consultation with the AGC, issued stern warnings to the six individuals who were formerly senior management of KOM. The decision was made by the Prosecution in the exercise of its discretion and professional judgment, taking into account all relevant considerations pertaining to the case. These included evidentiary difficulties in the case'for example, many of the documents were located in different jurisdictions, and key witnesses located outside of Singapore could not be compelled to give evidence here.
In addition, it should be noted that while the article claims that the US Department of Justice ('
DOJ
') 'caught six senior executives '¦ paying US$55m in bribes', only one individual was prosecuted in the US. The US DOJ did not charge any other KOM executives or publicly identify them.
Last, the article, when published on 14 January 2025, had alleged that there is a complete absence of laws or conventions requiring Political Office Holders to declare their financial interests, assets, or conflicts of interest.
This is false.
The
2005 Code of Conduct for Minister's
sets out the rules of obligation that all Minister's are to abide by.[8] In particular, there are rules which require Minister's to declare financial interests and assets, and rules on the acceptance of gifts and conflicts of interest.[9] In addition to and in the context of the Code, and as a matter of convention, Minister's who declare a relevant interest will be required to recuse themselves from decision-making in related matters.
Further Clarifications
Mr Barr has made allegations against Singapore for decades.[10] His comments are usually acerbic and biased, lacking any connection to the facts. Most Singaporeans ignore Mr Barr and the prescriptions he has proffered over the years. Singapore ranks 5
th
in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2023. In comparison, some other countries in the Index rank as follows: Australia (14
th
), United Kingdom (20
th
), United States of America (24
th
).
In the article, Mr Barr also suggests some impropriety in the reduction of the two charges against Mr S Iswaran ('
Mr Iswaran
').
Mr Iswaran was charged and convicted for receiving gifts, including whisky bottles and others, as set out in the High Court's judgment.[11] Mr Barr will know that in most countries such gifts would not attract any attention, let alone a criminal charge. He is mendacious in his allegations. Mr Barr can refer to the following cases, including the gifts received by former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson,[12] and United States Supreme Court Justices. [13]
Mr Barr has additionally made other bald accusations that Singapore's leaders'including the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew'conflated public interest and private interest and pursued self-interest while in office, suggesting that they engaged in wrongdoing, lacked integrity and/or were corrupt.
The Singapore government has zero tolerance for corruption. Minister's, Members of Parliament, and all public officers are expected to be scrupulously above board. Any evidence of wrongdoing would be fully investigated. While Mr Barr is free to express his opinions from afar, he is not free to make sweeping false allegations.
Conclusion
Singapore's governance system is built on a foundation of integrity and public service, carefully established over generations and upheld by successive leaders. This hard-won public trust is precious and must be safeguarded. The Singapore government remains steadfast in its commitment to earning and preserving the people's trust, including countering those who attempt to erode it by spreading falsehoods.

The Bloomberg article communicates the following falsehoods:
There are no publicly available government records of GCB sale transactions if caveats are not lodged.
The identity of the ultimate beneficial owner need not be disclosed to the government, and the government is therefore not aware of the ultimate beneficial owner's identity, in GCB property transactions bought using a trust arrangement or shell company.
GCB property transactions can be carried out without any checks by the government on the identities of the ultimate beneficial owners.
The primary responsibility to combat money laundering in property transactions is left to property agents and other service providers.
For GCB property transactions there is:
no publicly available government record of the GCB transaction if no caveat is lodged; and
no requirement to disclose to the government the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner in a trust arrangement or shell company;
and this allows parties (including Minister's and rich migrants) to transact such properties in a way facilitative of money laundering.
The falsehoods contained in the other publications are set out in the attached
Annex
.
These false statements attack the transparency of property transactions in Singapore. Together, these falsehoods give the impression that Singapore does not have a robust legal framework to require disclosure of information to the government in GCB transactions, which may allow wrongdoing to take place undetected. It is in the public interest that these falsehoods are addressed so that public confidence in the government is not undermined.
Facts:
Information on property ownership and transfers, including for all GCBs, is available on the Integrated Land Information Service portal ('INLIS'), regardless of whether a caveat was lodged for the sale transaction.
Information on property ownership and transfers, including for all GCBs, is available on INLIS which is managed by the Singapore Land Authority ('
SLA
'). This is regardless of whether a caveat was lodged for the sale transaction.
Caveats are not intended for tracking property transactions or ensuring transparency. The purpose of a caveat is to protect the interest of the purchaser, mortgagee or other parties that hold a legal right in the property. They are lodged

by parties who wish to protect their interest in a property. For example, one who purchases property may choose to lodge a caveat to protect his/her interest pending completion of the transaction and lodgement of the final transfer with SLA's Land Titles Registry.
The government mandates strict disclosure of identities and citizenship of purchasers and ultimate beneficial owners in all landed residential property transactions, including GCB transactions.
The government has clear disclosure requirements on the identities and citizenship of purchasers and ultimate beneficial owners for all landed residential property transactions, including GCB transactions. This is regardless of whether a caveat is lodged for the transaction, and regardless of whether the purchase is made by an individual, an entity, or through a vehicle such as a trust or company, including a shell company.
The government adopts a strict approach to the ownership of landed residential properties by foreigners. Under the Residential Property Act 1976 ('
RPA
'), foreign individuals (including Permanent Residents) and foreign entities seeking to acquire such properties must obtain approval. There have been no approvals given to any foreign purchasers to acquire any GCBs since 2021, in any capacity, whether personal or otherwise.
As part of the sale process for landed residential properties, including GCBs, SLA requires the purchaser's identity and citizenship to be declared to SLA when lodging the instrument of transfer at the Land Titles Registry. Furthermore, the purchaser's solicitor must certify that the information provided in the instrument of transfer is correct and that all relevant provisions of the RPA have been complied with.
In addition:
For all landed residential property transactions made through trust arrangements, solicitors are required to produce a copy of the trust deed to SLA. SLA checks and verifies the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner.
For all landed residential property transactions where the purchaser or beneficial owner is a company, the applicant has to meet strict requirements before it can obtain a Clearance Certificate to purchase the landed residential property. The company must be incorporated in Singapore and all their directors and members must be Singapore Citizens or Singapore entities as defined under the RPA. In addition, Singapore-incorporated companies are required by the Companies Act 1967 to maintain accurate and up-to-date information on their beneficial ownership.
The government has the primary responsibility to combat money laundering in property transactions, and has put in place a robust anti-money laundering ('AML') framework to counter money-laundering risks in property transactions.
The government has put in place a robust AML framework to counter money-laundering risks, which is applicable in the context of property transactions, including transactions made through trust arrangements and companies. The framework is underpinned by a three-pronged strategy:
Strengthening our legal and regulatory framework to
Prevent
criminals from operating in Singapore;
Developing measures to better
Detect
signs of illicit activity; and
Taking decisive administrative, regulatory and criminal measures to
Enforce
our laws.
The government requires regulated 'gatekeepers' in the private sector involved in property transactions to comply with AML requirements to conduct checks to identify and verify the identities of their customers, including the beneficial owners. Where there are higher risks, gatekeepers must also verify the sources of wealth of their customers. The financial institutions involved are required to know the customers and purpose of the transactions, and as needed, the sources of the funds. The requirements are strict and similar to standards in leading financial centres. Obligations are also imposed on lawyers handling the transactions, real estate salespersons, and estate agencies. These requirements and obligations are under law.
The government also requires these gatekeepers, including the financial institutions, to have processes in place to identify and file a Suspicious Transaction Report promptly with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office in the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force upon detecting any suspicious activities that may be linked to criminal conduct in their interactions with their customers. The government is responsible to analyse the information reported and take enforcement action.
The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to Bloomberg L.P., The Edge Singapore, The Independent Singapore and The Online Citizen in respect of their articles or posts. The Correction Direction requires the recipients to insert a notice against the original article or post (or in a specified online location, where the article or post has been removed), with a link to the Government's clarification.
Annex: Falsehoods communicated in each publication
The article by
The Edge Singapore
communicates the following falsehoods:
There are no publicly available government records of Good Class Bungalow ('
GCB
') sale transactions if caveats are not lodged.
The identity of the ultimate beneficial owner need not be disclosed to the government, and the government is therefore not aware of the ultimate beneficial owner's identity, in GCB property transactions bought using a trust arrangement or shell company.
GCB property transactions can be carried out without any checks by the government on the identities of the ultimate beneficial owners.
The primary responsibility to combat money laundering in property transactions is left to property agents and other service providers.
For GCB property transactions there is:
no publicly available government record of the GCB transaction if no caveat is lodged; and
no requirement to disclose to the government the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner in a trust arrangement or shell company;
and this allows parties (including Minister's and rich migrants) to transact such properties in a way facilitative of money laundering.
The article by
The Independent Singapore
communicates the following falsehoods:
There are no publicly available government records of GCB sale transactions if caveats are not lodged.
There is no requirement to disclose the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners, to the government, where GCBs are purchased through shell companies or trust arrangements.
For GCB property transactions there is:
no publicly available government record of the GCB transaction if no caveat is lodged; and
no requirement to disclose to the government the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner in a trust arrangement or shell company;
and this allows parties to transact such properties away from public scrutiny or government oversight.
The article by

a. TOC's article published on its website on 22 November 2024 ('TOC's article'); and
b. TOC's Facebook, Instagram, and X posts on 22 November 2024
The publications contain the following false statements:
a. The State suppresses dissenting views on the death penalty through the use of POFMA Correction Directions.
b. During the CNN Interview, Minister Shanmugam took contradictory positions about Singapore's anti-drug policies, i.e. despite claiming that Singapore was successful in controlling drug trafficking, the Minister also acknowledged rising arrests and the persistent availability of drugs.
Facts
:
The State does not suppress dissenting views on the death penalty through the use of POFMA Correction Directions
The State does not use POFMA to suppress those who speak up against the death penalty. The State only issues POFMA Directions if a false statement of fact has been communicated, and if it is in the public interest to do so.
A POFMA Correction Direction does not require the recipient to adopt the Government's position, or to remove the original post. It only requires the Government's position to be carried alongside the original post, so that readers can read the post containing the falsehoods, together with the official clarifications, and come to their own conclusion.
Transformative Justice Collective ('TJC') has been issued with several POFMA Correction Directions in relation to false statements they had published. In each case, a POFMA Correction Direction was issued because it was assessed that it was in the public interest to do so, as these false statements could erode public trust in the Singapore Government and our criminal justice system, if not clarified.
TOC has also presented an incomplete and misleading version of what the Minister said during an interview with the CNN
TOC has omitted relevant facts and selectively quoted the Minister, to reach the position that the Minister took contradictory positions about Singapore's drug policies.
During the interview, the Minister spoke about the experience of other countries, and explained that Singapore has had relative success in controlling the drug situation over the longer term.
In the 1990s, about 6,000 people were arrested annually for drug offences. Now, this number has fallen to about half, or about 3,000 people.
At the same time, Singapore was now richer, and the region was 'literally swimming in drugs'. There was also a more permissive environment towards drugs.
Singapore adhered to its zero-tolerance policy, including the capital punishment, because this approach saved more lives, kept Singapore safe, and contributed to our low crime rate.
The Minister cited a survey in the region where our drug traffickers largely come from, where more than 80% of respondents said that the death penalty was more effective in deterring serious crimes, such as drug trafficking. As a result of the death penalty, they did not want to traffic drugs into Singapore.
In context, it would be clear from the Minister's statements that Singapore's success must be understood in relative terms, and that without Singapore's zero-tolerance and comprehensive drug policy, including the death penalty, the drug situation in Singapore would be much worse.
The Minister also emphasised that it was a challenging environment, and that it must be a 'continuous fight'. Singapore must continue to deal with its challenges, including the proliferation of drugs in the region and a more permissive environment.
The full context of what the Minister said had not been set out by the article
. It is misleading (and hence false) for the author to omit relevant facts, and selectively quote the Minister, to reach the position that the Minister had taken contradictory positions about Singapore's anti-drug policies.

TJC
') on Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter) and TikTok on 3 Dec 2024 ('
TJC's FB, IG, X and TikTok posts
').
These publications contain a statement that a death row prisoner was scheduled for execution before he had the opportunity to submit his clemency petition to the President. This is not true.
Facts:
An execution will only be scheduled when a death row prisoner has exhausted all rights of appeal and the clemency process in relation to his or her conviction and sentence.
TJC's post made reference to a Court of Appeal ('
CA
') judgment issued on 11 October 2024,
Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin and others v Attorney-General
[2024] SGCA 39 ('
CA 30/2022
'). The death row prisoner mentioned in the video refers to Roslan Bin Bakar ('
Roslan
'), who was the only appellant in CA 30/2022 scheduled for execution on 15 November 2024. When Roslan's execution was scheduled and carried out, he had no outstanding relevant legal proceedings which would affect the carrying out of his sentence.
On 13 November 2024, Roslan filed an application to the courts for a stay of his execution ('
OAC 1/2024
'). The CA dismissed his application, and rejected his argument that he did not have sufficient opportunity to seek advice and to prepare a fresh clemency petition to the President arising from the CA's decision in CA 30/2022. The CA noted that more than a decade had passed since his appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the CA, and that he had lodged no fewer than five previous petitions for clemency ' which had all been rejected by the President. The CA also noted that Roslan was warned by his former counsel on 16 October 2024 (five days after the CA delivered its judgment in CA 30/2022) about the imminence of his execution, but he did not submit his clemency petition despite having close to one month after the warning. The CA further found that Roslan had no lack of legal advice in the background, and that the papers for his application in OAC 1/2024 were ready all along but were deliberately held back to create an 'artificial crisis of time', once notice of execution was given. The CA's decision in OAC 1/2024 is reported as
Roslan bin Bakar v Attorney-General
[2024] SGCA 51.
It was only on 13 November 2024 that Roslan wrote to the President to request an order of respite on his execution. Roslan was notified on 15 November 2024 that his request was rejected. The execution was then carried out in accordance with the law.
The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods.
The Minister for Digital Development and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ('

In TJC's FB, IG, X and TikTok posts, TJC also questioned if the government bodies who were the 'wrongdoers' in CA 30/2022 could be trusted to advise the President fairly in relation to clemency applications. It is clear that the government bodies here refer to the Singapore Prison Service ('

Article 22P of the Constitution provides that the President acts on the advice of the Cabinet in deciding whether to grant a clemency petition.
There is an established and robust process for the assessment of every petition for Presidential clemency. Reports from different parties are submitted alongside the Attorney-General's opinion, for the Cabinet's deliberation, before it advises the President. The Cabinet, and not SPS or AGC, assesses every petition fairly and impartially, and advises the President after considering all the relevant facts and circumstances of each case.

Transformative Justice Collective's ('TJC') Instagram post on 20 November 2024, with Kokila Annamalai and Rocky Howe added as collaborators; and
TJC's Facebook, TikTok and X posts on 20 November 2024.
Among other things, these publications assert that the three prisoners were executed without regard for their intellectual and psychosocial disabilities.
This is not true.
Facts:
In their post-appeal applications to the Court for re-sentencing, the PACPs argued that they suffered from abnormality of mind, which substantially impaired their mental responsibility for their acts and omissions in relation to the offences.  The Court considered the evidence they produced, and rejected their assertions.
Rosman
Rosman underwent trial in the High Court ('HC') for a capital drug trafficking offence. On 16 July 2010, he was convicted after the trial and was sentenced to death. He was trafficking in drugs enough to feed the addiction of about 690 abusers a week. His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal ('CA') on 26 April 2011.
Following amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act ('MDA') in 2012 (which introduced the discretionary death penalty)
1
, Rosman applied to the HC in 2015 to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment, on the basis that he should get the benefit of the amendments because he was only a courier, and that he had rendered substantive assistance to the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The HC dismissed his application, based on the facts.
On appeal to the CA, Rosman also argued, for the first time, that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, and thus satisfied the requirements under section 33B(3) of the MDA instead. Rosman relied on a private psychiatrist's report. At the same time, an earlier psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health ('IMH') dated 13 February 2013 stated that Rosman was
not
suffering from any mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence.
The CA considered the psychiatric reports and the arguments raised by Rosman in relation to his purported mental disabilities. The CA received expert evidence on the matter and found that Rosman's own investigation statements and the evidence adduced at trial clearly showed that he had exhibited clarity of mind at or around the time of the commission of the offence. The CA found that Rosman 'did weigh the costs and benefits of embarking on [his] criminal conduct and made the conscious and informed decision to do so, notwithstanding that he was fully apprised of the consequences of his actions'.
The CA dismissed Rosman's appeal.
Rosman's petitions to the President for clemency were rejected on 29 July 2019 and on 10 September 2020.
Pausi and Roslan
On 22 April 2010, Pausi and Roslan were convicted and sentenced by the HC to capital punishment for possessing diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, in quantity enough to feed the addiction of 1,150 drug abusers for a week. Their appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed by the CA on 17 March 2011.
Following amendments to the MDA in 2012, Roslan and Pausi applied to the HC in 2016 to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment under section 33B(3) of the MDA. Both claimed to be suffering from an abnormality of mind, which substantially impaired their respective mental responsibility for their acts and omissions.
The HC found that both Pausi and Roslan had displayed competence and comprehension of what they were doing when they carried out their act of trafficking in the drugs. The HC dismissed the applications on 13 November 2017. They appealed against the HC's decision and their appeals were dismissed by the CA on 26 September 2018.
Pausi and Roslan's petitions to the President for clemency were rejected on 13 September 2019.
Their death sentences were thereafter carried out in accordance with the law.
The Minister for Digital Development and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a POFMA Correction Direction to TJC's Facebook, Instagram and X posts, and a Targeted Correction Direction to be issued to TikTok Pte Ltd. The Correction Direction requires TJC to insert a Correction Notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification. TikTok will also be required to communicate a Correction Notice to all end-users in Singapore that had accessed the TikTok post. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours.
Additional Clarifications
TJC also pointed out that Rosman had been on the death row for 14 years. (Pausi and Roslan were similarly sentenced after trial to the death penalty in 2010, and were on death row for a similar period of time.)
This duration is significantly longer due to legal applications taken out by Rosman, and Pausi and Roslan.
Rosman
After Rosman's appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed on 26 April 2011, Rosman was an applicant and/or joint applicant in
nine
other legal proceedings which have been dealt with.
Rosman was initially scheduled for execution on 23 February 2022. One day before his scheduled execution, i.e. on 22 February 2022, he filed an application ('OS 174/2022'). His application was heard on 28 February 2022, and the HC ordered a stay of execution pending the outcome of the application.
On 16 March 2022, OS 174/2022 was dismissed by the HC. In its judgment, the HC held that the application (along with others) was an abuse of the process of the court, and ought to be dismissed.
Rosman's sentence was carried out on 22 November 2024 in accordance with the law.
Pausi and Roslan
After Pausi and Roslan's appeals against their conviction and sentence were dismissed on 17 March 2011, Pausi was an applicant in
eight
other legal proceedings and Roslan was an applicant in
14
other legal proceedings, all of which have been dealt with.
These applications were considered by the Court. Many were found to be unmeritorious, and a deliberate attempt to stymie the carrying out of their punishments. For instance, in
Roslan bin Bakar & Pausi bin Jefridin v Attorney-General
[2022] SGCA 20, the CA noted that the applicants had used judicial review proceedings to put forward the same baseless arguments which they had canvassed in earlier criminal proceedings. This amounted to an abuse of process.
Pausi and Roslan were first scheduled for execution on 16 February 2022. On 14 February 2022, i.e. two days before their scheduled execution, Pausi and Roslan's lawyers filed an application to Court to be granted leave to set aside their capital sentences.
On 15 February 2022, the CA dismissed the application. After the dismissal, on the same day (i.e. 15 February 2022), another application was filed by their lawyers, asking for leave to commence judicial review proceedings. On the morning of 16 February 2022, the HC heard and dismissed the application. They appealed to the CA on the same day. In view of the pending appeal, the President ordered a respite of the judicial executions. The appeal was ultimately dismissed.
Roslan was also one of the applicants in a court application challenging the constitutionality of the Post-appeal Applications in Capital Cases Act 2022 ('OA 972'). Prior to his execution, Roslan sought a stay of execution on the basis of, amongst other things, this pending proceeding. The CA dismissed the application for a stay, and took the view that 'OA 972 [was] not a relevant proceeding that warrants a stay of execution'.
An execution will only be scheduled when a prisoner has exhausted all rights of appeal and the clemency process in relation to his or her conviction and sentence. At the time their sentences were carried out, the three PACPs had no outstanding relevant legal proceedings which would affect the carrying out of their sentences.
TJC has also referred to the CA's ruling in
Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin & 12 others v Attorney-General
[2024] SGCA 39 ('CA 30'), and pointed out that Rosman and Roslan were among the applicants in that case. The Ministry of Home Affairs has explained to Parliament that most of the documents shared with AGC were in the context of scheduling the executions of PACPs
2
. The officers believed in good faith that the documents could be shared with AGC, for the purpose of seeking legal advice on scheduling, and ensuring that the PACPs' rights were not infringed in terms of further steps being taken with regard to their sentences.
The CA upheld the HC Judge's award of nominal damages (of $10 each) to three of the 13 prisoners, for breach of copyright. The CA said that there was no basis for the prisoners' claims for further damages. The CA also noted that no breach of confidence arose from the prison officers opening or perusing any of the documents, because they were entitled to do so under the Prisons Regulations.
The PACPs were scheduled for carrying out of their sentences, according to guidelines accepted by the CA in
Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Attorney-General
[2021] 1 SLR 809. Contrary to TJC's assertions, there was no 'hurry' to schedule the execution of prisoners such as Rosman, who were applicants in CA 30.
Conclusion
The PACPs Rosman, Pausi, and Roslan were afforded due legal process. Their capital sentences were upheld after the Court had fully considered and rejected their claims and evidence in relation to their purported mental disabilities. Their executions were scheduled only upon the exhaustion of all rights of appeal, as well as the clemency process.

The 2012 amendments to the MDA introduced a departure from the mandatory death penalty for a capital offence of drug trafficking or importation, if certain requirements were met.
First, under section 33B(2) of the MDA, if the offender played the role of a courier, and had been certified by the Public Prosecutor to have substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore, the court had the discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, instead of the death penalty.
Second, under section 33B(3) of the MDA, if the offender played the role of a courier, and suffered from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence, the court must sentence him to life imprisonment, instead of the death penalty.

What some may not have realised is that the survey applies to expatriates, not Singaporeans.
The EIU's Worldwide Cost of Living (WCOL) survey is designed to help human resource managers and finance managers around the world calculate cost of living allowances and build compensation packages for expatriates and business travellers. It does not reflect the cost of living for Singaporeans.
The EIU's WCOL survey's consumption basket does not reflect what Singaporeans usually consume.
The WCOL survey looks at the prices of a common set of products and services in the various cities to allow for city-to-city comparisons. As such, its consumption basket - which includes items such as international school fees and 'three-course dinners at a top restaurant for four people' - does not reflect what Singaporeans regularly consume and is therefore not a good gauge of cost of living for Singaporean households.
A more representative indicator of cost of living in Singapore is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change in the prices of a basket of goods and services commonly purchased by Singaporean households. More information on the CPI can be found in the Singapore Department of Statistics' website
here
.
The rankings are sensitive to currency fluctuations.
The WCOL survey converts the prices of goods and services in the cities surveyed to US dollars to facilitate comparisons across cities. Singapore's strong exchange rate thus contributes to its higher ranking compared to other cities with weaker exchange rates. However, a stronger currency does not raise the cost of living of Singaporeans who earn their income in Singapore dollars. On the contrary, a stronger Singapore dollar helps to dampen imported inflation in Singapore by lowering the prices of our imports (in Singapore dollars) and subsequently, consumer prices.
Are prices in Singapore going up?
Cost of living concerns are not unique to Singapore. Around the world, food and energy prices have gone up, which have in turn raised the prices of many goods and services. However, inflation in Singapore has peaked and is on a broad moderating path, easing to 2.0% in September 2024. Nonetheless, price levels remain high due to the earlier increases in inflation. The Government therefore continues to help households cope with cost of living concerns.
How is the Government helping Singaporeans to manage rising costs?
1.
Managing domestic supply-side constraints
. This includes managing the supply of industrial and commercial space, to help moderate business cost increases and reduce the knock-on impact on consumer prices.
2.
Promoting competition in markets so that Singaporeans can enjoy competitive prices
. This includes lowering barriers to entry for businesses, where possible. It also entails diversifying the sources of supply, including for food, to prevent sharp price increases in the event of disruptions.
3.
Appreciating the Singapore dollar to dampen imported inflation
. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) tightened monetary policy five times over 2021-22 and continues to keep the trade-weighted Singapore dollar exchange rate on a gradually appreciating path. A strong Singapore dollar reduces the costs of imported goods and services.

Providing targeted assistance, particularly for the lower- to middle-income households
Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Lawrence Wong enhanced the Assurance Package (AP) in Budget 2024 to help Singaporeans cope with cost-of-living concerns, with more support for lower- to middle-income households. The enhancements will also
on average
, fully cover the increase in spending by lower-income households and substantially cover the increase in spending by middle-income households, due to inflation in 2024.
Since the start of the year, eligible Singaporeans would have already received the following:
CDC Vouchers in January and June totalling $800;
2024 AP MediSave and 2024 AP Seniors' Bonus in February;
Four tranches of U-Save and S&CC rebates in January, April, July and October;
2024 GST Voucher (GSTV) ' Cash and GSTV ' MediSave in August; and
Cost-of-Living (COL) Special Payment in September.
Eligible Singaporeans will also receive the Assurance Package Cash, as well as the MediSave Bonus and Retirement Savings Bonus under the Majulah Package in December 2024.
The Government recognises Singaporeans' cost of living concerns and will continue to monitor the situation closely and support Singaporeans through these challenging times.",1.2185555,4.8947163,2024,2,"Employment (Read: Cost of Living, Foreigners)",No target; Explainer

There is no link to the current retirement age of 63 or the re-employment age of 68. Even if the retirement age and the re-employment age are raised, the CPF payout eligibility age would remain unchanged.
Factually summarises what you need to know.
1. There is no change to the Payout Eligibility Age ' it is 65
The Payout Eligibility Age, which is 65 years old, is the age that you can start receiving your retirement payouts.
2. You decide when you start your payouts
Each CPF member, not the CPF Board, decides when to start his/her own retirement payouts. This has always been the case.
3. Starting your CPF payouts is simple
About six months before they turn 65, CPF members will receive a letter from the CPF Board. It includes an application form to start payouts. They only need to fill in basic information - name, NRIC, contact and bank account details - and mail the completed form to the CPF Board.
They can also start their payouts by making an application online on the CPF website or at a CPF Service Centre.
For members who do not apply, CPF Board will continue to remind them in their CPF Yearly Statement of Account.
4. CPF Board will start payouts if you don't do so by age 70
In the past, some CPF members did not submit their applications to start their payouts. This resulted in their savings staying in their accounts until they passed away.
To help CPF members enjoy a stream of income in retirement, CPF Board automatically starts their payouts at age 70 if they have not applied to do so by then..
5. You will get more, if you start your payouts later
CPF members can start their payouts anytime between age 65 and 70.

The Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn posts make the following false statements:
The State carries out executions without regard for due legal process.
The Government targets, silences and harasses Transformative Justice Collective (TJC) and other individuals for speaking up against the death penalty.
Facts:
Facts pertaining to Azwan's case
Azwan was accorded due legal process.
Azwan was arrested on 17 October 2015 and underwent trial in the High Court ('HC') for a capital drug trafficking offence.
He was convicted after the trial and was sentenced to death on 11 February 2019 for possessing not less than 26.5g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking.
His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal ('CA') on 24 October 2019.
He was represented by legal counsel for the trial and the appeal, provided under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences ('LASCO').
His applications for clemency were denied by the President on 23 March 2020 and on 15 June 2022.
Since his appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed in October 2019, Azwan has been a joint applicant with other PACPs in three legal proceedings. All these proceedings were dismissed by the HC and/or CA as they were found to be unmeritorious. In one of these applications, the Court found that the application was an abuse of the court process.
On 12 April 2024, Azwan was given notice that his execution was scheduled on 19 April 2024. At that point, he was only involved in one pending court application, i.e.  HC/OA 306/2024 ('LASCO application'), where he and other PACPs sought a declaration that the policy of not assigning LASCO counsel for post-appeal applications was unconstitutional. The LASCO application did not seek a stay of execution.
On 16 April 2024, three days before his scheduled execution, Azwan filed a Criminal Motion ('CM 14') to the CA seeking a stay of execution on the basis that he was involved in the LASCO application. On 17 April 2024, the CA allowed CM 14 and ordered a stay of execution pending the outcome of the LASCO application. The LASCO application was struck out by the HC on 20 May 2024. Azwan and the other PACPs appealed against the HC's decision and the CA dismissed the appeal on 9 September 2024.
On 19 September 2024, Azwan together with 30 PACPs filed a fresh application ('OA 972') challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions introduced under the Post-appeal Applications in Capital Cases Act 2022. OA 972 was a civil application which had no bearing on Azwan's conviction and sentence. Again, the application in OA 972 did not seek a stay of execution.
On 30 September 2024, Azwan was given notice that his execution was scheduled on 4 October 2024.
On 1 October 2024, three days before his scheduled execution, Azwan filed another application for a stay of execution ('CM 40'). Azwan's basis for filing CM 40 was that, amongst other reasons, OA 972 was still pending and he intended to file a 'review application' against his conviction after OA 972 had been determined by the Court. On 3 October 2024, the CA dismissed CM 40. In its judgment, the CA found that Azwan's 'intended review application [had] no prospect of success whatsoever and there [was] no basis for the Court to stay his execution to await the outcome in OA 972'.
Accordingly, Azwan's execution was carried out on 4 October 2024.
Executions are only scheduled when a prisoner has exhausted all rights of appeal and the clemency process. This was so in Azwan's case. After being notified of his execution date on both occasions, he filed last-minute applications to the Court to stay the execution of his sentence ' the first in April 2024 (i.e. CM 14) was allowed by the Court and his execution was stayed; the second in October 2024 (i.e. CM 40) was dismissed by the Court. Azwan's execution was not scheduled without regard for due legal process.
The Government did not target, silence and harass TJC and other individuals for speaking up against the death penalty.
The Government takes action against organisations and individuals who spread false information (for instance, about the death penalty and its use) where it is in the public interest to do so.
TJC has been issued with several POFMA Correction Directions ('CDs') in relation to its false statements about (amongst others) the purported arbitrary laws and processes relating to the death penalty and the implementation. In every one of the cases, the Government had assessed that it was in the public interest to issue the CDs as the false statements cast serious aspersions on the Government and the criminal justice system, and could undermine public confidence in public institutions.
The CDs issued against TJC simply required them to carry a Correction Notice on the posts containing the falsehoods. There was no requirement for the text of the original posts to be removed or altered. Readers can still read the falsehoods, and consider the Government's clarifications alongside it. The Government does not, through the use of POFMA or otherwise, silence any organisation or individual for speaking out against the death penalty. The Government only seeks to correct falsehoods.
The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods.
The Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a CD to ADPAN's Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn posts. The CD requires ADPAN to insert a Correction Notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.

Facts:
Facts pertaining to Azwan's case
Azwan was accorded due legal process. His execution was not scheduled or stayed arbitrarily.
Azwan was arrested on 17 October 2015 and underwent trial in the High Court ('HC'). The HC considered the evidence adduced at trial and the arguments put forth by the Prosecution and Azwan's lawyers. He was convicted after the trial and was sentenced to death on 11 February 2019 for possessing not less than 26.5g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking.
His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal ('CA') on 24 October 2019. He was represented by legal counsel for the trial and the appeal, provided under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences ('LASCO').
His applications for clemency were denied by the President on 23 March 2020 and on 15 June 2022.
Since his appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed in October 2019, Azwan has been a joint applicant with other PACPs in three legal proceedings. All of these proceedings were dismissed by the HC and/or CA as they were found to be unmeritorious. In one of these applications, the Court found that the application was an abuse of the court process.
On 12 April 2024, Azwan was given notice that his execution was scheduled on 19 April 2024. At that point, he was only involved in one pending court application, i.e.  HC/OA 306/2024 ('LASCO application'), where he and other PACPs sought a declaration that the policy of not assigning LASCO counsel for post-appeal applications was unconstitutional. The LASCO application did not seek a stay of execution.
On 16 April 2024, three days before his scheduled execution, Azwan filed a Criminal Motion ('CM 14') to the CA seeking a stay of execution on the basis that he was involved in the LASCO application. On 17 April 2024, the CA allowed CM 14 and ordered a stay of execution pending the outcome of the LASCO application. The LASCO application was struck out by the HC on 20 May 2024. Azwan and the other PACPs appealed against the HC's decision and the CA dismissed the appeal on 9 September 2024.
On 19 September 2024, Azwan together with 30 other PACPs filed a fresh application ('OA 972') challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions introduced under the Post-appeal Application in Capital Cases Act 2022. OA 972 was a civil application which had no bearing on Azwan's conviction and sentence, and did not seek a stay of execution.
On 30 September 2024, Azwan was given notice that his execution was scheduled on 4 October 2024.
On 1 October 2024, three days before his scheduled execution, Azwan filed another application for a stay of execution ('CM 40'). Azwan's basis for filing CM 40 was that, amongst other reasons, OA 972 was still pending and he intended to file a '
review application
' against his conviction after OA 972 had been determined by the Court. On 3 October 2024, the CA dismissed CM 40. In its judgment, the CA found that Azwan's '
intended review application [had] no prospect of success whatsoever and there [was] no basis for the Court to stay his execution to await the outcome in OA 972
'.
Accordingly, Azwan's execution was carried out on 4 October 2024.
Executions are only scheduled when a prisoner has exhausted all rights of appeal and the clemency process. Some PACPs have repeatedly filed last-minute applications to prevent the punishment from being carried out. Whether a stay of execution should be granted is decided by the Courts. Any last-minute stay of execution is therefore a result of the prisoner's own decision to file applications late. They are, contrary to what has been (falsely) alleged, not decided arbitrarily by the Government.
In Azwan's case, he filed two last-minute applications to stay the execution of his sentence ' the first in April 2024 (i.e. CM 14) was allowed by the Court and his execution was stayed; the second in October 2024 (i.e. CM 40) was rejected by the Court. Azwan's execution was not arbitrarily scheduled and stayed, nor without regard for due legal process.
The Prosecution always bears the legal burden of proving a drug trafficking charge against the accused person
In all criminal cases, the Prosecution bears the legal burden of proving the charges against an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. This also applies to offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 ('MDA'), including drug trafficking.
Under Section 17 of the MDA, anyone who is proved to have possessed specific amounts of controlled drugs is presumed to have possessed those drugs for trafficking. Even where the Prosecution relies on this presumption, it still bears the legal burden of proving the material elements of the charge, i.e. the fact of possession and knowledge (of the nature of the drugs), beyond a reasonable doubt. The use of presumptions is only an evidential tool to prove certain elements of an offence upon proof of a predicate fact. Such presumptions can be rebutted if the accused person is able to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he or she was not trafficking in drugs.
The false statements could erode public trust in the Singapore Government and our criminal justice system.
The Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue POFMA Correction Directions to TJC's article, TJC's FB, IG, TikTok and X posts, and Kokila's FB and X posts; and for a Targeted Correction Direction be issued to TikTok Pte Ltd.

Whether you're an individual or a business, you can alert SingCERT to cybersecurity incidents if you think you've been a victim of a phishing e-mail, if your company's website has been defaced or if its computer network has been compromised. SingCERT can assist to find possible remediation or provide referrals to specialised vendors who can best remediate the threat.
What are CERTs? Does Singapore have a CERT?
CERT, or Cyber Emergency Response Team, is the first responder to cybersecurity incidents. CERTs are neither new  nor exclusive to Singapore. They exist in different countries and provide advice on best practices in computer security to prevent and handle incidents.
What does SingCERT do in the event of a cyber incident?
SingCERT examines the nature of the cyber incident and issues advice on remediation measures for affected users to take. SingCERT also shares crucial information on specific incidents, when available, with businesses and members of public to prevent them from falling victim, and to minimise the potential impact of the cybersecurity incident.
Because cyber threats are borderless, SingCERT works with other CERTs to issue advisories on critical cybersecurity incidents around the world.
SingCERT also partners with international CERTs on drills to strengthen capabilities and coordination efforts.
Can SingCERT find out who hacked my system and apprehend the culprit?
SingCERT is not a law enforcement agency. It does not have the authority to investigate criminal acts, like account hacking or impersonation/phishing scams. Cyber crime investigations are carried out by the Singapore Police Force.
What else does SingCERT do?
To fend off potential cyber threats, SingCERT issues timely technical alerts and advisories to the public, to highlight security vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation measures.
Through outreach efforts, SingCERT encourages the cultivation of good cyber hygiene practices, so that businesses and members of public are better equipped to protect their devices and information.

Key Facts
The prices for sale of state land to HDB are
not
set by the Government. Rather, the
Chief Valuer (CV) determines the fair market value (FMV), and the sale price is set with reference to the FMV
.
The CV is an independent office, whose appointment requires the President's concurrence and whose professional assessment is made without influence from the Government.
The CV uses established valuation principles, which are similarly adopted by professional valuers in the private sector.

The Government
provides housing grants to ensure public housing affordability
, and not to boost the reserves.
HDB does not price new HDB flats to recover cost. Instead, HDB first establishes the market value of the flats and applies a significant market discount to the assessed market values to ensure BTO flats are affordable to flat buyers. Tiered housing grants are offered by HDB, using money from taxpayers, to provide targeted help to those who need it the most.

Changes to the TCs at a glance:
May 2011
' AHTC was formed, after the May 2011 General Elections (GE) when the Workers' Party (WP) won the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC). AHTC took over management of Aljunied GRC from ATC from 1 August 2011. This included all properties, rights, and liabilities, including contracts such as that for the TCMS provided by AIM.
February 2013
' AHTC was reconstituted and changed its name to AHPETC, after WP won a By-Election for Punggol East SMC.
October 2015
' AHPETC was reconstituted and changed its name to AHTC, after the September 2015 GE, where Punggol East SMC was won by the People's Action Party (PAP) and grouped under Pasir Ris-Punggol TC (PRPTC). PRPTC took over management of Punggol East SMC from 1 December 2015. This included all properties, rights and liabilities, including directions given by the court[3]
.
July 2020
' Sengkang TC (SKTC) was formed, following the July 2020 GE after WP won Sengkang GRC (including Punggol East SMC due to boundary changes). SKTC took over from PRPTC all properties, rights and liabilities, including directions given by the court, from 28 October 2020.
Falsehoods and Facts
#1 Falsehood: MND was wrong to call in external auditors because it was AIM's termination of the TCMS on insufficient notice and handover issues with the previous ATC that led to AHTC's failures in reporting to MND and its audit findings.
Facts: MND had legitimate and sufficient basis to call in external auditors. Many of the audit findings by AHTC's own auditors and independent accountants, and the Auditor General's Office (AGO) did not result from the termination of AIM's TCMS and handover issues with the previous ATC in 2011. These failures and issues also persisted long after these events in 2011.
Mr Yee's post was misleading because it omitted important context that it was the serious audit observations against AHTC by its own auditors that led MND to call for further audit checks:
Before the audits by AGO in 2014 and an independent accountant in 2016, AHTC's own auditor (Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton) had submitted a disclaimer of opinion for AHTC's Financial Statements for two consecutive years ' FY2011/12 and FY2012/13. This was the first such occurrence in the history of TCs. Such disclaimers of opinion by auditors are highly unusual and serious matters. In this case, the disclaimer meant that
AHTC's own auditors could not say that the financial statements provided a true and fair account of AHTC's financial position. Among other failures, AHTC did not provide the auditors its latest management of accounts and records of minutes, and details of project management service fees paid to a related party
.
A substantial portion of TC funds are public funds. TC funds include the S&CC collected from residents by the TCs and the S&CC Operating Grants disbursed by MND to the TCs. AHTC's auditors' disclaimer of opinion therefore raised questions regarding the usage of and accountability for the public funds managed by AHTC. Hence, it was in the public interest for MND to step in and request for the Ministry of Finance to appoint the AGO to carry out an audit.
AGO found that AHTC had several lapses in governance and compliance with the Town Councils Act (TCA) and the Town Councils Financial Rules. These findings were related to AHTC's financial governance processes and usage of AHTC funds, and are not related to financial information reporting to MND per se.
AGO concluded that until AHTC addressed these weaknesses, there could be no assurance that AHTC's accounts were accurate and reliable, or that public funds were properly spent, accounted for and managed
.
In light of AGO's findings, MND called for AHTC to appoint independent accountants
(IAs)
in March 2015, and KPMG LLP (KPMG) was appointed by AHTC as part of a court order.[4] See
Annex
for a summary of the key findings from Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton (FKT), AGO and KPMG.
Mr Yee's insinuation that MND placed excessive and unnecessary pressure on AHTC paints a misleading picture. Contrary to Mr Yee's claims, there is
no reasonable basis
to suggest that AIM's termination of the TCMS contract on insufficient notice or handover issues had caused all the TC's process and system weaknesses. The key reasons are summarised below.
The observations in AHTC's FY2012/13 Auditor Reports raised
serious questions about the reliability and accuracy of the TC's financial and accounting systems
. As part of the Disclaimer of Opinion issued by FKT, several audit observations were raised relating to AHTC's actions in 2012 and 2013, well after the handover in 2011.
KPMG found in 2016 that AHTC's control failures were pervasive, cutting across the key areas of governance, financial control, financial reporting, procurement and records managements over the course of five years, which shows that
they persisted for a significant time.
KPMG also assessed that the root causes of AHTC's lapses were related to the TC's governance framework and policy management, accounting practices, and accounting system used to record and account for the TC's transactions, as well as the TC's Finance Department's capability and management personnel retention. The identified lapses and root causes show that several lapses were
inherent to the TC rather than due to AIM's termination of the TCMS or handover issues in 2011
.
Mr Yee's assertion that AHTC's reporting failures were due to AIM's termination of the TCMS is groundless. In December 2014, AHTC blamed its failure to report its S&CC arrears to MND on not being able to use AIM's TCMS. This ignores the fact that AHTC had submitted its monthly arrears reports for 19 months from October 2011 to April 2013
without using AIM's TCMS
. Furthermore, Hougang TC was able to submit its S&CC arrears reports to MND for years since 2008 without using AIM's TCMS.
In fact, Mr Yee's claim that AIM's TCMS was terminated on insufficient notice is false. The full circumstances and chronology of events are set out in MND's 2013 Town Council Review Report which was debated in Parliament in May 2013. In June and August 2011, AHTC had requested to extend its use of AIM's TCMS by one month (1 to 31 August 2011) and by nine days (1 to 9 September 2011) respectively. On both occasions, AIM had agreed to the extensions. Given that both requests for extension were acceded to and AHTC did not request for any further extension, there is no basis for alleging that the TCMS was terminated on insufficient notice.
#2 Falsehood: MND's decision to withhold grants from AHTC, to call in external auditors and to call for an IP were politically motivated and not based on legitimate concerns.
#3 Falsehood: MND withheld grants from AHTC in order to put pressure on AHTC to appoint an IP.
Fact: MND's actions against the TC were necessary to safeguard public funds.
MND acted because of the many audit concerns raised by AHTC's own auditors and AGO as explained above.
MND was fulfilling its statutory responsibility under the TCA to ensure that TCs have adequate governance processes in place to safeguard public funds that are entrusted to them and to channel these funds to the purpose for which they are given
.
Given the questions raised regarding AHTC's financial governance processes during the various audits, it would have been irresponsible for MND to have disbursed the S&CC Operating Grants to AHTC without any safeguards.
As such, MND offered on two occasions in October 2014 and August 2015 to disburse the grants to AHTC, with reasonable conditions such as (i) AHTC to declare that all earlier submitted statements were true; (ii) AHTC to put in place safeguards for the proper accountability of the disbursed funds; and (iii) AHTC to provide its latest bank account position. However, AHTC did not take up MND's offer on both occasions.
The withheld grants were eventually disbursed to AHTC in April 2016, after AHTC had appointed KPMG as its IA and accepted MND's conditions set in relation to the grants[5]
. This was because as AHTC's appointed IA, KPMG would help AHTC identify its non-compliances with the TCA, advise the TC on appropriate remedial steps, and establish whether any past payments made by the TC were improper and ought to be recovered.
Fact: The formation of the IP was not a pre-condition by MND for the disbursement of the withheld S&CC operating grants. Such funds were disbursed before the IP was even formed.
The formation of the IP was not a pre-condition by MND for the disbursement of the withheld S&CC operating grants. This is evident from the fact that
the withheld grants were disbursed in April 2016, nearly a year before the formation of the IP
.
KPMG's Past Payments Review Report, submitted to AHTC and HDB on 31 October 2016, identified large sums of improper payments from TC funds. Therefore,
HDB
[6]
wrote to AHTC in November 2016, to request that the TC appoint a suitable third party to follow through to recover the improper past payments identified by KPMG.
After studying the KPMG Past Payments Review Report, AHTC decided to appoint an IP to
review the findings made by KPMG and take such actions as deemed appropriate to safeguard AHTC and its residents'  interests
. The IP was appointed by AHTC on 17 February 2017.
The appointment of an independent third party was necessary to avoid any potential conflict of interest. KPMG had found serious legal and regulatory breaches, large sums of improper payments made from TC funds, and the possibility of criminal conduct.
KPMG also found that AHTC might potentially look to the Town Councillors for the recovery of losses arising from any breaches of their fiduciary duties. As the Town Councillors make decisions for AHTC, the appointment of an independent third party to represent the interests of AHTC was necessary in this case to avoid any potential conflict of interest
.
#4 Falsehood: The IP members were decided by MND, and were not independent.
Fact: The IP Chairman was appointed by AHTC, and he in turn appointed the other members of the IP.
MND did not decide on any of the IP members.
The IP is an agent of AHTC pursuant to section 46(2) of the TCA.
 It was AHTC that appointed the IP Chairman in 2017 and allowed him to make the decision on the identity of the other two IP members as he deemed appropriate, or to pick one member from a shortlist by AHTC and the other from a shortlist by HDB. The IP Chairman only made his selection after confirming with AHTC that it had no objection to him making his selection from HDB's shortlist. It is unclear whether AHTC itself provided any shortlist to the IP Chairman.
Per the IP's Terms of Reference, the IP did not take any direction or instruction from HDB, MND or any other person. The IP was independent and impartial, and as an agent for AHTC, was supposed to act in the best interests of AHTC.

AIM's TCMS was an integrated system that TCs used to manage their resident and property data, and essential services such as S&CC collection, contractor payments, facility bookings, etc. TCs also used the platform to generate data used in their annual financial statements.

[2]
Following the Punggol East by-election in 2013, AHTC was known as 'Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council' or AHPETC, until after the General Election in 2015, where it was reconstituted and changed its name to AHTC on 1 Oct 2015. For purposes of this article, we will refer to the Town Council as AHTC for simplicity.
[3]
This refers to the directions given by the Court of Appeal on 27 November 2015, which included the order that then-AHPETC must appoint Independent Accountants. See paragraph 1(d) for details. Following the takeover of Punggol East SMC from AHTC, PRPTC took over the obligation to comply with these directions.
[4]
Pursuant to the Court Order, AHTC appointed KPMG as the IA, to assist in identifying outstanding non-compliances with the TCA, advise the TC on appropriate remedial steps to be taken, and establish whether any past payments made by AHTC were improper and ought to be recovered.
[5]
The conditions included AHTC setting up segregated bank accounts to receive the grants, and getting the IAs to co-authorise and co-sign large payments out of these accounts.
[6]
In its Judgment on 27 May 2015, the High Court ruled that HDB (and not MND) was the proper party to seek a court order to compel AHTC to comply with its obligations under the Act. HDB then filed an application to be joined as a party to the proceedings, which was allowed by the Court of Appeal in its Judgment on 27 November 2015.

AHTC's FY2012/13 Audited Financial Statements and Auditor's Report
(By M/s Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP, submitted to MND on 10 February 2014)
AGO's Audit Report
(By AGO, published on 9 February 2015)
Key Lapses
(a) The TC did not transfer funds into its Sinking Funds as required under Rule 4(2B)(a) of the Town Councils Financial Rules;
(b) The TC did not make available information to the auditors details of project management service fees paid to a related party;
(c) The TC did not make available to the auditors its latest management accounts and records of minutes subsequent to the financial year end, to allow the auditors to ascertain if the TC's financial statements properly reflected any required adjustments or disclosures made.
The AHTC auditor expressed a disclaimer of opinion on the TC's FY2012/13 financial statements.
(a) Monies not transferred to the TC's Sinking Fund as required by law;
(b) Inadequate oversight of related party transactions involving ownership interest of key officers;
(c) Weak internal controls and systems to monitor payments received and made; and
(d) Lack of a system to safeguard important documents or keep proper accounts as required under the law.
AGO concluded that until the TC addressed these weaknesses, there could be no assurance that AHTC's accounts were accurate and reliable, or that public funds were properly spent, accounted for and managed.
Root Causes
(By KPMG, submitted to HDB in April and July 2016)

(a) AHTC's governance framework and policy management,
(b) AHTC's accounting practices
(c) AHTC's accounting system used to record and account for the TC's transactions,

Falsehoods and Facts
Falsehoods:
No income means test is applicable to HDB grants for resale flats.
Facts:
HDB's resale grants for first-timer families comprise the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG), CPF Housing Grant (CPF HG) and Proximity Housing Grant (PHG).
The EHG and the CPF HG are both means-tested.
The EHG which was recently enhanced on 20 Aug 2024
by up to $40,000, is means-tested by income and applies to both BTO flats and resale flats. First-timer families can receive up to $120,000, from $80,000 before the enhancement.
The EHG is
means-tested
and
progressively tiered
so that lower-income buyers will receive more support. This will ensure that those in need will receive more help.
The CPF HG is also means-tested by income and by flat type.
Only eligible first-timer buyers of resale flats with monthly household income not exceeding $14,000 qualify for the CPF HG. These buyers may receive $80,000 if buying a 2-room to 4-room resale flat, or $50,000 if buying a 5-room or bigger resale flat.
To further encourage extended families to live together in the same flat for mutual care and support, the PHG provides up to $30,000 for families buying a resale flat to live with parents or children, and $20,000 to live near parents or children.
The $230,000 maximum grant for resale flats which Mr Leong Sze Hian quotes, includes the means-tested EHG and CPF HG component. Before the enhancement to the EHG, resale flat buyers would only have been eligible for $190,000 in maximum resale grants.
These substantial housing grants provide direct and targeted support to first-timers to afford their homes, with more support for lower-to-middle income households. MND and HDB are committed to providing homes to meet the diverse housing needs of Singaporeans and supporting their home ownership aspirations.

The definition of a stillborn child was changed when the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 2021 (RBDA 2021) was amended. The stillbirth threshold was changed from 'after the 28th week of pregnancy' to 'after the 22nd week of pregnancy', to align with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases statistical reporting guidelines. This definition was brought into force on 29 May 2022.
Arising from this definitional change, there was an increase in the number of stillbirths reported in 2022 and 2023. To aid in the interpretation of the data, the amendment to the definition of a stillborn child was clearly stated alongside reported data, in Note 4 of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA)'s Singapore Demographic Bulletin Report (SDB Report) Q4 Oct-Dec 2023, as well as in Explanatory Note 22 and footnote 8 of the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD Report) 2023. Both reports are published on the ICA website.
Earlier this year, the RBDA 2021 was further amended to change the stillbirth threshold from 'after the 22nd week of pregnancy' to 'after the 24th week of pregnancy'. This amendment was made following feedback to remove any potential confusion regarding foetal viability by aligning the stillbirth threshold with the cut-off for abortions in the Termination of Pregnancy Act 1974, which allows a foetus no more than 24 weeks to be aborted, after which, an abortion is only allowed due to medical exigencies. This definition of stillborn child was brought into force on 16 April 2024.
Overall, the stillbirth and perinatal mortality rates in Singapore continue to compare well with other high-income countries globally. To illustrate this point, the number of stillbirths after the 28th week of pregnancy (i.e. using the previous definition of stillborn child) has remained stable (
Figure 1
). Similarly, when the previous definition of stillborn child is applied to perinatal mortality (which refers to deaths of infants under one week of age and stillbirths) and perinatal mortality rates, the baseline trend of stillbirths and perinatal mortality remains stable (
Figure 2
).
It is inaccurate and misleading to compare the number of stillbirths before and after the changes to the definition of stillborn child, without the appropriate contextual information that was provided. ICA will continue to include footnotes and explanatory notes in both SDB and RBD reports on the definitional changes, alongside reported data on stillbirths and perinatal mortality, to contextualise data interpretation. We urge the public to avoid speculation and to verify information found on the Internet against authoritative sources.

The PACPs referred to in these posts were afforded due legal process.
In respect of the PACP executed on 2 August 2024, an earlier Factually article dated 8 August 2024 at
https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually080824/
has detailed the relevant facts relating to him, in particular, that he was afforded due legal process.
The PACP executed on 7 August 2024 (the '
2
nd
PACP
') was similarly afforded due legal process.
The 2
nd
PACP was arrested on 24 October 2017 and underwent trial in the High Court in 2019 and 2021. The High Court considered the evidence adduced at trial and the arguments put forth by the Prosecution and the 2
nd
PACP's lawyers. He was convicted after the trial and was sentenced to death on 10 August 2021. His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal ('
CA
') on 11 May 2022.
The 2
nd
PACP's application for clemency was denied by the President on 14 October 2022 and again on 22 November 2022 (when another clemency petition was submitted on his behalf).
On 3 December 2022, the 2
nd
PACP filed a legal application for permission to review the CA's decision to dismiss his appeal against his conviction and sentence.  This application was summarily dismissed by the CA on 28 February 2023.
The 2

PACP was also a joint applicant with other PACPs in one other legal application which was dismissed by the CA on 27 March 2024. The CA found that the application amounted to an abuse of the court's process.
On 31 July 2024, the 2
nd
PACP was given notice that his execution was to take place on 7 August 2024. As at the date of the execution notice, the 2

PACP had one pending civil appeal (jointly with other PACPs).
On 5 August 2024, the 2
nd
PACP filed a Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal in respect of the civil appeal, which was accepted on the same day by the Court. As such, there were no ongoing legal proceedings involving the 2

PACP when his execution was carried out on 7 August 2024.
Facts in relation to the second false statement
Laws in Singapore, including those relating to the death penalty, are considered and enacted by the Legislature (consisting of the Parliament and the President), according to proper legal process. Any law that is sought to be introduced or amended must go through the Parliamentary process and be assented to by the President, before it becomes law. Our laws are not made arbitrarily.
The criminal justice system in Singapore requires every accused person facing a capital charge to go through a full trial, where evidence is considered by the Court before it decides whether to convict the accused person and impose the capital sentence.
All persons in Singapore are subject to the law.  If they choose to traffic drugs in Singapore, they will face the penalty according to the law. This penalty is the death sentence if they traffic drugs in quantities above the capital sentence threshold.
Our laws are not enforced arbitrarily.
The false statements could erode public trust in the Singapore Government and the Judiciary.

Scheduled executions are arbitrarily stayed at the last minute.
The State arbitrarily makes laws in relation to the death penalty.
Facts:
The PACP referred to in these posts was afforded due legal process.
The PACP was arrested on 12 April 2016 and underwent trial in the High Court in 2018. The High Court considered the evidence adduced at trial and the arguments put forth by the Prosecution and the PACP's lawyers. He was convicted after the trial and was sentenced to death on 15 February 2019. His appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (CA) on 25 November 2019.
The PACP's application for clemency was denied by the President on 20 May 2020.
Thereafter, the PACP went on to file three legal applications for permission to take out review proceedings in respect of his appeal ('
review applications
'). Two of these review applications were filed within days of his scheduled executions '
He was first scheduled for execution on 24 September 2020. On 22 September 2020, he filed his first review application, and an order of respite was granted by the President on 23 September 2020 so that the CA could consider the review application. The application was summarily dismissed by the CA on 12 October 2020.
He was next scheduled for execution on 26 April 2024. He filed his second review application on 19 April 2024. The execution was stayed by the CA, for the Prosecution to respond to the matters he raised. The application was summarily dismissed by the CA on 21 May 2024.
He filed the third review application on 27 June 2024, despite being statutorily prohibited from doing so. The application was summarily dismissed by the CA on 30 July 2024.
The PACP was represented by counsel of his choice in all three of his post-appeal review applications. In all, he was represented by no fewer than eight lawyers throughout these legal proceedings. He was not denied legal counsel at any stage.
The PACP was also a joint applicant with other PACPs in three other legal proceedings. All of these had been dismissed by the High Court and/or the CA as they were found to be unmeritorious. Pertinently, in two of these applications, the Court found that they were an abuse of the process of the courts.
On 29 July 2024, the PACP was given notice that his execution was to take place on 2 August 2024. As at 29 July 2024, the PACP had two pending legal applications: (i) his third review application' this was materially similar to the first two that had already been dismissed by the CA previously; and (ii) a civil appeal (jointly with other PACPs), relating to the High Court's decision to strike out an application for a declaration that the policy of not assigning Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences (LASCO) counsel for post-appeal applications was unconstitutional.
The pending review application was statutorily prohibited under s 394K(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010. On 30 July 2024, the CA dismissed the application, and found it to be 'totally without merit' and that 'its commencement and continuation was an abuse of the process of the Court'. Accordingly, the Court found that the application was an abuse of process and dismissed it before the sentence was carried out.
The outcome of the civil appeal would have had no bearing on his conviction and sentence.  The CA confirmed this on 2 August 2024 before the PACP's sentence was carried out.
Thus the prisoner was scheduled for the sentence to be carried out with due legal process.
All PACPs have access to legal counsel throughout court proceedings. They are assigned legal counsel under the LASCO, and will be provided legal representation for their trial and appeals. After their right of appeal has been exhausted, they are free to engage counsel of their choice to represent them in any post-appeal applications. They are not denied legal counsel in court proceedings. Their cases are not deliberately scheduled to be heard at short notice.
An execution will only be scheduled when a prisoner has exhausted all rights of appeal and the clemency process. Some PACPs have abused the court process by deliberately and repeatedly filing last-minute applications to prevent the punishment from being carried out. In such cases, the stay (if granted by the Court) is occasioned by the prisoner's own decision to file applications at the last minute. The scheduled executions are not arbitrarily stayed by the State. They are stayed by reason of the prisoner's own applications.
Where such applications are filed, the Court will have to consider if there is merit in them.
Laws in Singapore, including those relating to the death penalty, are considered and enacted by the Legislature (consisting of the Parliament and the President), according to proper legal process. Any law that is sought to be introduced or amended must go through the Parliamentary process and be assented to by the President, before it becomes law. A significant majority of Singaporeans support the laws relating to capital punishment in Singapore. Our laws are not made arbitrarily.

1. The EIP offers no benefit to ethnic minority households; instead, it only causes them significant financial detriment when they sell their flats.
2. The EIP was introduced in the 1960s and has not been changed to date.
Falsehoods and Facts
#1 Falsehood: The EIP offers no benefit to ethnic minority households; instead, it only causes them significant financial detriment when they sell their flats.
Facts:
The EIP was introduced to prevent racial enclaves and ensure racial diversity in HDB neighbourhoods in support of racial harmony.
The EIP benefits ethnic minorities in several ways.
Benefits at point of initial sale
Because of the EIP, a defined proportion of flats are set aside for ethnic minority communities ('Minority Communities') in all HDB developments (including more popular ones) through its BTO and SBF exercises and through open booking. This is a significant benefit because the EIP
guarantees
that a specified minimum number of flats in HDB estates, including in highly sought after estates, are available for persons from Minority Communities. Flats in more popular areas are generally higher priced. But the significant Government subsidies given by HDB make them affordable.
Mr Shaik Amar himself benefited from the EIP, because his household would not have been able to select an SBF flat if there was no EIP. During the SBF exercise where his household had booked their SkyOasis @ Dawson flat, all minority First-Timer applicants were invited to select a 3-room flat in Queenstown, including Mr Shaik Amar's household. In comparison, only about 40% of Chinese First-Timer applicants were invited to select a flat because of the Chinese EIP limit.
Without the EIP, we would risk the proportion of owners from Minority Communities in more popular developments being significantly lower, even at point of sale by HDB. The EIP, in this way, generally enables more households from the Minority Communities to benefit from the increase in value that takes place when a flat bought from HDB is resold at a higher price. It is misleading to focus on the point of resale, without setting out that flats are first obtained within the framework of the EIP.
Benefits over time
Further, the EIP applies not just at the point of purchase of flats at HDB's sales exercises, but also at point of resale.
This ensures that no ethnic group is excluded from any public housing neighbourhood, even over time.
Today, nearly one in three HDB blocks, and 11% of HDB neighbourhoods have reached their EIP limits. Without the EIP, over time, we may see fewer flat owners from the Minority Communities in highly sought after housing estates. This would be detrimental to the Minority Communities.
First, they would not be able to benefit from future increases in value for flats in such estates.
Second, segregation generally affects Minority Communities more than it affects ethnic majority communities ('Majority Communities'). By setting limits on the proportion of each ethnic group allowed in a HDB block or neighbourhood, it has been possible to have ethnically diverse neighbourhoods across Singapore, and opportunities for interaction and understanding across races. On the flipside, increased segregation would reduce opportunities for multicultural interactions, and ultimately weaken our racial harmony.
No significant financial detriment
'¢ It is false that the EIP causes all minority households to suffer significant detriment when they sell their flats.
'¢ The Government has publicly acknowledged that for a small number of EIP-constrained flat owners, at point of resale, there can be differences in the prices that a potential Chinese buyer might be willing to pay, compared with a potential buyer from the Minority Communities.
'¢ Over the years, HDB has put in place a range of measures to assist these EIP-constrained flat owners, including giving EIP-constrained flat owners more time to sell their existing flat if they have purchased another one, and waiving the EIP limits in exceptional circumstances.
'¢ In addition, HDB has, since 2022, put in place a scheme to buy back flats from eligible EIP-constrained owners who face genuine difficulties selling their flats. For such households, HDB offers to buy back their flats at a fair price based on prevailing market conditions. They are therefore not forced to sell at unreasonably low prices offered by other buyers. These flats are then offered for sale through SBF exercises or open booking.
'¢ As with all flats sold through SBF exercises or open booking, HDB applies a significant subsidy to the assessed market value of the flat to determine the sale price. For blocks or neighbourhoods where the Chinese EIP limit is reached, only buyers from the Minority Communities will be eligible to buy such flats, and they will benefit from the subsidies, like other buyers.
#2 Falsehood: The EIP was introduced in the 1960s and has not been changed to date.
Facts:
Since the introduction of the EIP in 1989 (not the 1960s), we have made, and publicly announced, adjustments to the EIP:'¯
In 2010, we announced the increase of the Indians/Others EIP limit by 2%-points, i.e. from 10% to 12% at the neighbourhood level, and from 13% to 15% at the block level.
Over the years, HDB has put in place a range of measures to assist these EIP-constrained flat owners, including giving EIP-constrained flat owners more time to sell their existing flat if they have purchased another one, and waiving the EIP limits in exceptional circumstances.
In 2022, we announced the EIP buyback assistance scheme, where HDB will buy back flats from eligible EIP-constrained owners who face genuine difficulties selling their flats.

:
The Government intentionally sets artificially high land prices, for sale to HDB.
The endowment and trust funds are not transparent.
The Government maintains a large land bank of heritage properties to keep land prices as high as possible and preferably rising rapidly. This is part of the Government's strategy of boosting the reserves.
Falsehoods and Facts
#1 Falsehood: The Government intentionally sets artificially high land prices, for sale to HDB
Facts
The prices for sale of state land to HDB are not set by the Government. Rather, the Chief Valuer ('CV') determines the sale price, and fixes it with reference to the fair market value.
The CV is an independent office, whose appointment requires the President's concurrence, and whose professional assessment is made without influence from the Government.
Further, the CV determines the sale price based on established valuation principles, taking into consideration relevant resale transactions on the open market, and other relevant factors such as specific parameters of the site. Such valuation principles are similarly adopted by professional valuers in the private sector.
#2 Falsehood: The endowment and trust funds are not transparent
Facts
Top-ups to the endowment and trust funds can be found in the Revenue and Expenditure Estimates (i.e., the Budget book) and the Supply Bill, which are tabled to Parliament for approval.
The amount of top-up to each endowment and trust fund, as well as the starting and ending-FY balance and annual outlay, can be found in the various Financial Statements published by either the Government, the relevant Statutory Board appointed as the trustee / agent / custodian, or the Institution of a Public Character / charity. These Financial Statements are publicly accessible.
Key expenditure items making up the total outlay of each fund are also listed within the respective Financial Statement of each fund. For example, the Statement of the GST Voucher Fund in the Government Financial Statements breaks down the annual disbursement into the four components of the GST Voucher scheme, i.e. (i) GST Voucher - Cash, (ii) GST Voucher - MediSave, (iii) GST Voucher - S&CC Rebate, and GST Voucher - U-Save.
#3 Falsehood: The reason why the Government maintains a large land bank of heritage properties is to keep land prices as high as possible and preferably rising rapidly. This is part of the Government's strategy of boosting the reserves.
Facts
The Government's approach to land management is based on Singapore's planning and development needs, and not to maximise land sales proceeds nor to increase the value of the reserves. Certain properties in Singapore are not redeveloped but conserved because of their heritage and/or historical value. This was explained by Minister Edwin Tong in his Ministerial Statement on the rentals of state properties on 3 July 2023.
The Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Finance, Chee Hong Tat, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his Facebook post, dated 15 June 2024. The Correction Direction requires recipients to insert a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.
Additional Clarifications
The reserves benefit current and future generations of Singaporeans.
The post also claims that 'Singaporeans derive little to no benefit from the reserves'. This is misleading.
Singaporeans benefit from our reserves. How our reserves and the Net Investment Returns Contribution ('NIRC') have benefited Singaporeans has been highlighted on various platforms, including the MOF website
1
and the CNA documentary on reserves
2
.
For example, the NIRC, which comprises the investment returns of our reserves, supplements the annual Budget each year to fund public spending
3
. For the financial year which ended on 31 March 2024, the NIRC was approximately $22.9 billion. The NIRC has provided an annual revenue stream of about 3.5% of GDP on average over the past 5 years.
The reserves also serve as our crisis fund. During the Global Financial Crisis and across FY2020 to FY2022 in our fight against COVID-19, our reserves helped us to weather crises without having to incur debt that will have to be borne by future generations. The total draw on past reserves for COVID-19 response measures across FY2020 to FY2022 was about $40 billion. By tapping on the reserves, the Government was able to fund public health measures as well as economic and social support measures, to save lives and protect livelihoods.
The Government remains committed to providing affordable public housing.
The post claims that 'Singaporeans may not be able to afford sky high public housing'. This is misleading.
About 80% of Singapore's resident population live in HDB flats, of which about 90% own their homes. This is one of the highest home ownership rates in the world.
HDB prices new flats with affordability in mind. HDB flats are priced significantly below comparable market value, as the Government provides market discounts to ensure affordability for Singaporeans. There are a wide range of HDB flats to meet different budgets and needs.
HDB also offers substantial grants to offset the purchase price of flats. First-timer families buying BTO flats can receive up to $80,000 in housing grants on top of the subsidised flat price, while resale flat buyers can receive up to $190,000 in grants.
In 2023, 8 in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their new flats or bought resale flats with HDB loans had a mortgage servicing ratio of 25% or less upon key collection. This means they can service their monthly HDB loan instalments with their CPF contributions, with little to no cash outlay.

The posts make the following false statements:
That the three women were prosecuted for organising support for the Palestinian people in the ongoing Gaza war, in the form of a procession to the Istana; and
That the Government, and in particular Minister K Shanmugam, prosecuted the three women because they had expressed views that the Government did not agree with.
Falsehoods and Facts
#1 Falsehood: That the women were prosecuted for organising support for the Palestinian people in the ongoing Gaza war, in the form of a procession to the Istana
Fact
The three women - Ms Annamalai Kokila Parvathi, Ms Siti Amirah Mohamed Asrori, and Ms Mossammad Sobikun Nahar ' were charged for an offence under Section 15(1) of the Public Order Act 2009 (the 'POA'), for organising a procession in a
prohibited
area designated under Section 12 of the POA and the Public Order (Prohibited Areas) Order (i.e. in the vicinity of the Istana).
They were not charged for organising support for the Palestinian people. Organising support for the Palestinian Cause is not a criminal offence. The Government itself has organised many events in support of the Palestinian Cause.
#2 Falsehood: That the Government, and in particular Minister K Shanmugam, prosecuted the three women because they had expressed views that the Government did not agree with
Fact
As mentioned above, the three women were prosecuted for their alleged involvement in organising a procession in a prohibited area. They were not prosecuted for the views they had expressed.
The decision to charge the three women was made by the Attorney-General's Chambers, after its review of the Police's investigative findings. The decision was not made by Minister K Shanmugam. The Minister does not make decisions relating to criminal prosecutions.
MHA would like to reiterate that the three women were charged for offences under the POA, for their alleged involvement in organising a procession in the vicinity of the Istana, which is a designated prohibited area. Any person who organises a public assembly or a procession in a designated prohibited area would have committed the offence, regardless of the cause or issue he or she is advocating for. Prohibited areas are security sensitive areas, and also include the Parliament House and the Supreme Court.
These laws exist to maintain the public peace and good order which Singaporeans enjoy today.
We know that some Singaporeans feel strongly about the Israel-Hamas conflict, in support of both sides of the conflict. The very large majority of these views have been expressed in lawful ways, online and also during the many forums and dialogues that have been organised by the authorities and other entities, as well as through support for donation drives.
We would like to urge members of the public not to engage in activities that will damage the peace, public order and social harmony which Singaporeans have worked hard to achieve, and enjoy today. We should not deliberately break the law, even if to make a point. If we do so, eventually, we will become a lawless, unstable, and disorderly society.

The Facebook post states that the Prime Minister and Minister for Law can influence the size of performance bonuses paid to specific High Court Judges.
This is untrue:
Under Article 98(6) of the Constitution, the Legislature shall by law provide for the remuneration of the Supreme Court Judges. The Judges' Remuneration Act 1994 sets out the framework for the salaries, allowances and privileges accorded to Supreme Court Judges as a class. The annual pensionable salary of Supreme Court Judges as a class is fixed by law.
It is the Chief Justice who then determines the salary and bonuses to be paid to each Supreme Court Judge, within the scope of the framework set out in law.
Neither the Prime Minister nor any Minister can determine or influence the payments to be made to specific Judges under this framework.
Further, the Constitution provides that a Supreme Court Judge's remuneration and other terms of office shall not be altered to his disadvantage after his appointment.
[1]
Mr Jeyaretnam's allegation is thus false.
Additional Clarifications
Mr Jeyaretnam's Facebook post makes other statements which are misleading and give an inaccurate picture.
Judicial Appointments
The Constitution governs the process for the appointment of Supreme Court Judges, including their appointment to a higher court. Supreme Court Judges are appointed by the President, acting in his discretion, if he concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister. The Constitution requires the Prime Minister to consult the Chief Justice before tendering his advice on the appointment of Judges to the President.
[2]
In putting forward names, a wide variety of people may be and often are consulted. Such persons will include lawyers in private practice, lawyers in Government, as well as others who may have knowledge of the persons being considered for appointments.
Once appointed, the Constitution guarantees the security of tenure and remuneration of the Supreme Court Judges.
[3]
Judges may only be removed on grounds prescribed in Article 98(3) of the Constitution, and only pursuant to the recommendation of a tribunal of at least five persons who hold or have held office as Supreme Court Judges, or who hold or have held equivalent office in any part of the Commonwealth.
Apart from Supreme Court Judges, the Constitution also sets out the process for the appointment and promotion of officers of the Singapore Judicial Service. This is within the exclusive control of the Judicial Service Commission, which is headed by the Chief Justice.
[4]
By omitting these critical facts about the judicial appointment process, Mr Jeyaretnam seeks to undermine public confidence in the judicial system and the many men and women of Singapore's Judiciary and the Singapore Judicial Service.
Defamation Law
Mr Jeyaretnam says that defamation laws only serve to protect those in power.
This is inaccurate.
People should be entitled to protect themselves against false allegations against them which affect their reputations. In Singapore, the protection afforded by defamation law applies equally to everyone. A notable example is Mr Chiam See Tong, one of Singapore's most respected opposition politicians. Throughout his career, he rigorously scrutinised the Government and those in power and has never been sued for defamation. In fact, he has taken action against others, including two former Government Minister's, for defaming him. The Minister's apologised and reached an out-of-court settlement with him.
Conclusion
Mr Jeyaretnam has repeatedly published false and misleading statements. This is the seventh correction direction issued to him. His latest post continues to propagate false and unfounded statements, reflecting a deliberate intent to undermine our public institutions.
The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong, has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction Direction to Mr Jeyaretnam. The Correction Direction requires him to insert a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.

Misleading Flat Listing in Sengkang
The advertisement for the $2 million ""jumbo flat"" in Sengkang was misleading as there are
no jumbo flats in the area
(Blk 314C Anchorvale Link). The unit listed was two adjacent 5-room flats, which are not eligible to be converted into and sold as a single unit.
Additionally, the listing price for the flat is well above the recent transacted prices in the area. Over the last six months, 5-room flats in the area transacted for around $580,000.
The agent has since taken down the listing after the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) pointed out the misleading advertisement. CEA is also investigating the matter and will take firm action if any breaches are found.
Unrealistic Flat Listing Price in Toa Payoh
The 5-room DBSS listed for $2 million was nearly $500k above the highest transacted price in the area. Many property market experts said that this is an unrealistic asking price, even for a DBSS flat with attractive attributes.
At the current listed prices, the DBSS flat and the two 5-room flats in Sengkang will come with significant Cash-Over-Valuation (COV), which has to be fully paid in cash upfront.
Code of Conduct for Property Agents
Property agents must uphold the integrity and professionalism of the industry, and avoid disrupting the market and fanning consumer sentiment. To protect the interests of the public and promote information transparency to facilitate informed decisions by prospective buyers, CEA will look into the information presented by property agents when they market HDB flats.
Ensuring affordable homes for Singaporeans
In 2023, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their new flats or bought resale flats had a mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) of 25% or less upon key collection. This means that they can service their monthly HDB loan instalments with their CPF contributions, with little to no cash outlay.
While the HDB resale market transacts on a 'willing buyer-willing seller' basis, prospective buyers are advised to exercise prudence in their housing purchases, especially in the current economic and geopolitical climate. The Government remains committed to ensuring that public housing remains affordable to Singaporeans and maintaining a stable and sustainable property market.

The Ministry of Manpower would like to clarify misconceptions on social media regarding the purpose of the CPF system and why the SA will be closed.
Key facts
The
core priorities of the CPF system are to provide for members' basic retirement needs, as well as support their housing and healthcare needs
. Even as the CPF system evolves, these three key needs of Singaporeans remain fundamental.
The
core principle behind closing the SA for CPF members aged 55 and above is to 'right-site' CPF monies
, such that only CPF savings committed for retirement earn the higher long-term interest rate.
With the raised Enhanced Retirement Sum from 1 January 2025,
more than 99% of CPF members aged 55 and above today would be able to transfer all their SA savings to their Retirement Account (RA)
, if they do not wish to keep these savings in their Ordinary Account after the closure of SA. They will be able to continue earning the higher long-term interest rate, and receive higher retirement payouts.
For members on CPF LIFE, savings transferred to their RA will be automatically annuitised under CPF LIFE and continue to earn interest.
CPF LIFE is an insurance scheme
that addresses the risk of outliving one's savings by providing members with lifelong monthly payouts. Members can choose their CPF LIFE plan depending on their desired retirement lifestyle. Interest earned form part of members' monthly payouts, allowing them to receive higher payouts from the start. When a member passes away, interest that has not been paid to him is pooled and goes towards providing monthly payouts for surviving CPF members. It is this risk-pooling that enables CPF members to receive monthly payouts for as long as they live, even when their CPF LIFE premiums have been exhausted.

False Statement of Fact
Dr Chee Soon Juan claimed that the Government has rejected the idea of building flats that can accommodate multi-generational living.
This claim is false.
HDB builds and offers 5-room and 3Gen flats to cater to the housing needs of larger families and multi-generation families who wish to live together. In particular, 3Gen flats, which are generally larger (at about 115 sqm) with 1 extra bedroom compared to the typical 5-room BTO flat, have been introduced since 2013 to allow multi-generation families to live together. 5-room flats were offered in all Build-To-Order ('BTO') launches last year, and 3Gen flats were offered in two of the four launches.
Dr Chee referred to a reply by HDB to a forum letter from a member of the public, in support of his claim. Contrary to Dr Chee's claim, the Government did
not
reject the suggestion from the forum letter writer to have bigger flats available for multi-generational living. (See
HDB's reply to the Straits Times Forum letter
dated 2 Jan 2023.) In planning the supply of new BTO flats, HDB adopts a comprehensive approach, considering factors such as the prevailing economic and housing market conditions, and long-term demographic and socio-economic trends. HDB offers a wide range of different flat types in various locations to meet demand, including from larger families and multi-generational families, and to calibrate the BTO supply and flat types to cater to the housing needs and budgets of households in Singapore.
Dr Chee quoted from HDB's forum reply dated 2 January 2023 without including the following information from the HDB's reply about the larger flat types offered by the HDB to accommodate multi-generational living:
'We offer a wide range of flats, from two-room flexi flats to three-generation flats, in various locations to cater to the different housing needs and budgets of first-timer families, second-timer families, the elderly and singles'¦ Nevertheless, HDB continues to build five-room and three-generation flats to meet the needs of larger families and multi-generation families who wish to live together, a point which Mr Ong raised.'
Additional Clarifications
Types of HDB flats offered
HDB offers a wide range of flats, from 2-room flexi flats to 3Gen flats, in various locations to cater to the different housing needs and budgets of first-timer families, second-timer families, the elderly and singles. Among the flat types, 4-room flats remain the mainstay of HDB's BTO supply, as they are an affordable option for families and popular with first-timers. Like 5-room flats, 4-room flats come with three bedrooms.
Over the years, HDB has also improved flat designs to better optimise the use of space and cater to flat buyers' evolving lifestyle needs. For example, columns in some new flats are pushed to the edges where possible, to give flat owners more flexibility to reconfigure their flat layout.
As more young couples, singles and their parents choose to have their own flats instead of living together, the average household size of resident households living in HDB flats has decreased from 3.75 persons in 1997 to 3.04 persons in 2023. Nevertheless, HDB flat sizes have remained unchanged since 1997, and HDB will continue to build 5-room and 3Gen flats. In addition to BTOs, home buyers who wish to purchase such larger flats can also consider the resale market.
Forward Singapore Report
Dr Chee Soon Juan's video referenced the Forward Singapore (FSG) Report, and concluded from the report that 'the Singapore Dream is now out of reach for many Singaporeans'.
The FSG exercise aimed to provide a roadmap towards a more vibrant and inclusive Singapore with opportunities for all Singaporeans to pursue their aspirations, and learn and progress across diverse pathways. The FSG Report emphasises the need to refresh the Singapore Dream, as the FSG engagements with young Singaporeans found that the Singapore Dream has expanded beyond material success. The relevant extract of the FSG Report is as follows:
Page 13:
'From our engagements, it was clear that the idea of the Singapore Dream is not limited to material success. In particular, there have been discernible shifts in our youths' mindset. When young people talk about careers and jobs, they often express a desire for meaning and purpose in what they do, not just for good salaries. In other words, we want to embrace wider definitions of success. We seek a more inclusive Singapore Dream ' one where we value every individual, support them in their diverse aspirations and pathways, and celebrate their achievements and successes together.'

Mr Jeyaretnam
') published an article on The Ricebowl Singapore on 16 February 2024, and reposted it on Facebook, X, and LinkedIn on the same date. The article and reposts make the statement that SLA mismanaged State properties by charging Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below market value for 26 and 31 Ridout Road, and giving them preferential tenancy terms.
This is untrue
. The falsehood has also been republished by Gutzy Asia (on the Gutzy Asia website, and on Facebook and X), and by The Online Citizen Asia (on Facebook).
Rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road were at market value
SLA rented out 26 and 31 Ridout Road in 2018 and 2019, respectively, at fair market value and not below market valuation. At the time, 26 and 31 Ridout Road had been vacant for years. The market conditions were weak and generally on a downward trajectory. This is shown in the chart in the Annex, which was made public during the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2023.
After the initial three-year term, SLA renewed the tenancies for 26 and 31 Ridout Road in 2021 and 2022. This was also done at market rent. A revaluation of the rentals was carried out by professional valuers to peg the rentals to the prevailing market rate.
Regarding 26 Ridout Road in particular, Minister Shanmugam had recused himself, in respect of the rental transaction, and no matter had been raised by SLA to MinLaw during the entire rental process. The professional valuer from SLA who determined the Guide Rent for 26 Ridout Road did not know the identity of the prospective tenant at the material time, and only learnt that the tenant was Minister Shanmugam after the matter was reported in the media.
These facts are public. The facts were established in the Report on the Review of the Rentals of State Properties at No. 26 and No. 31 Ridout Road conducted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean ('
Review
'), and covered extensively in the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2023, including details of how the market value was arrived at. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau ('
CPIB
') also found no evidence that the Minister's were given favourable rental rates due to their positions.
Mr Jeyaretnam knows these facts. He has been issued with Correction Directions under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ('
POFMA
') on multiple previous occasions for making false statements of fact in relation to the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road.
However, Mr Jeyaretnam's article and reposts glaringly omit these facts. Instead, he states falsely that SLA has mismanaged State properties by renting out 26 and 31 Ridout Road at below market rentals. He also makes an inappropriate and erroneous comparison of the rentals for 26 and 31 Ridout Road, and the recent rental bids for 41 Malcolm Road. It is misleading for Mr Jeyaretnam to suggest that the properties are directly comparable, without making any attempt to refer to the established facts relating to the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road, or to account for the fact that property market conditions do not remain static. Market conditions today are stronger than they were when the Ridout Road properties were initially rented out and subsequently renewed.
Tenancy durations for 26 and 31 Ridout Road accord with SLA's general policies
SLA grants tenancies of heritage bungalows on 2 or 3-year terms, and up to a maximum of 3+3+3 years in the first instance, depending on the circumstances, including the likely capital expenditure that the tenant will incur to live in the property.
The tenancies for the Ridout Road properties kept within the maximum 3+3+3 tenancy period. The Minister's had incurred substantial costs to improve the State properties, the benefit of which will accrue to the State when the tenancies eventually come to an end.
These facts are also public. These facts were made clear in the findings of the Review, and during the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2023. Mr Jeyaretnam knows these facts. Despite this, he states that the tenancy durations for 26 and 31 Ridout Road were 'exceptionally generous', compared to the tenancy duration listed for 41 Malcolm Road. This falsely represents that SLA gave the Minister's preferential tenancy terms, contrary to what has been established.
Conclusion
Mr Jeyaretnam has a track record of publishing false statements regarding the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road. The matter of the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road was independently and extensively investigated by CPIB and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean. The facts have been clarified and published. From July to November 2023, Mr Jeyaretnam was issued with five Correction Directions under the POFMA for various falsehoods made in relation to the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road. His latest article shows that he chooses to persist in making false statements on the matter, even though he clearly knows the true facts.
The Government takes a serious view of Mr Jeyaretnam's conduct and will consider if any further action should be taken against him.

Mr Leong has identified the couple by a photograph. Those falsehoods were later republished by The Online Citizen (on Facebook) and Gutzy Asia (on Facebook, X and the Gutzy Asia website).
Financial assistance for daily expenses
It was falsely claimed that the couple only receives a Home Caregiving Grant (HCG), and currently does not receive any other form of financial assistance from public sector agencies in relation to their daily expenses.
In truth, the couple also receives financial assistance each month from the People's Association in the form of NTUC vouchers (since February 2022) and Community Development Council Utilities Vouchers (since March 2022).
Since 2021, the couple has received approximately $39,000 in cash and vouchers from various public sector agencies and community partners. This included $21,000 in ComCare assistance from May 2021 to April 2023.
MediSave funds
It was falsely claimed that the woman had used up most of the funds in her MediSave account to pay for an operation on her leg.
In truth, the cost of the woman's inpatient treatment at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH), including her leg operation, was about $8,580. After Government subsidies of about $6,300, MediShield Life and MediSave, her remaining bill amount was about $240. Prior to her leg operation, the woman had more than $60,000 in her MediSave account. As at 12 February 2024, she continues to maintain a balance of more than $60,000 in her MediSave account.
Affordability of physiotherapy
It was falsely claimed that the woman stopped attending physiotherapy sessions at a hospital because she had to pay $100 to the hospital for each session.
In truth, all of the woman's outpatient physiotherapy sessions at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH), which cost around $25 per session after Government subsidies, were fully covered by MediFund. She did not have to pay any cash out-of-pocket.
Assistance for transport costs
It was falsely claimed that the couple's application to a public sector agency for assistance with transport costs was rejected.
In truth, the Ministry of Transport granted their household's application for the Public Transport Voucher (PTV) in the 2021 exercise. PTVs were also granted to them in the 2022 and 2023 exercises. The man redeemed the 2023 PTVs on 15 January 2024.
The man has also been receiving subsidised medical escort and transport services from community care providers since 2021. When the woman fractured her ankle, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) offered to refer her to subsidised medical escort and transport services, but she had declined the offer.
Further background
The man is 60-years-old and the woman is 55-years-old. They currently have more than $100,000 in total in both their CPF Retirement Accounts. The woman was entitled to and did withdraw $5,000 from her CPF account in April 2023.
The man has been receiving the HCG since November 2022. Since March 2023, the HCG provides him with $400 each month.
The couple also receive non-financial support. An officer from the People's Association also visits the couple regularly, and has ferried them for hospital visits, bought meals for them when they could not leave the house and helped them run other errands.
Advisory
False statements, such as those made by Mr Leong in his social media posts, erode public trust and mislead the public about the support that is available and provided to families who are in need.

Some may wonder why this is so given that the Government runs a balanced budget, and whether it is fiscally sustainable. We explain why Singapore takes on such debt.
A country's debt position is commonly measured by its gross debt-to-GDP ratio, which compares a country's public debt to its economic output. While Singapore's gross debt-to-GDP ratio may appear large on its own, it does not consider Singapore's sizeable asset position.
In fact, the Singapore Government has a strong balance sheet with no net debt. Our financial assets are well in excess of our debt. This net asset position is reflected in the net investment returns generated on our reserves, which is made available for Government spending via the Net Investment Returns Contribution. In addition, our strong balance sheet explains why Singapore receives the top credit rating of AAA from the three leading international credit-rating agencies (S&P, Moody's, and Fitch).

This is factually incorrect. By citing people he knew who have succumbed to the virus, he seemed to also suggest that the vaccines were ineffective, or worse, were the cause of the deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic chapter of world history, but we need to draw the right conclusions and follow the scientific evidence.
Viruses naturally mutate as they transmit and replicate, and there is no evidence that the mRNA vaccines contribute to this. Specifically for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the COVID-19 Delta variant had already developed before the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, and caused a major COVID-19 wave globally, and many deaths around the world.
Contrary to what Dr Oon said, the mRNA vaccines also do not contain the live SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mRNA vaccine comprises RNA material, which is translated to a viral protein, that triggers the immune response in humans.  It does not rely on inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
On the suggestion to take antiviral drugs like Tamiflu to treat COVID-19 as it is a potent neuraminidase inhibitor, we would like to highlight that Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is used to treat influenza infection. Multiple studies have found that Oseltamivir was ineffective in inhibiting SARS-Cov-2
in vitro
, did not improve patients' symptoms, and also did not slow down disease progression.
Finally, there is a very big body of scientific evidence that shows that vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness and deaths amongst those infected with COVID-19. This is the primary reason why Singapore recorded one of the lowest excess death rates in the world during the pandemic ' because the great majority of Singaporeans took the vaccines. The protection is not 100%, which means that a small proportion of vaccinated individuals still unfortunately succumb to the infection, especially if they are old and vulnerable. But that does not mean the vaccines caused the deaths. The COVID-19 virus did, and the vaccines, while effective, could not protect all.",5.0853224,3.8177364,2023,7,Health (Read: Covid),Gabriel Oon

False Statements of Fact
First, the article states that most of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) has been transferred into long term funds and therefore does not contribute to actual spending.
This is untrue.
The NIRC comprises the investment returns of our reserves, which supplement the annual Budget each year to fund public spending.
[1]
For the financial year which ended on 31 March 2023, the NIRC was approximately $22.4 billion. How our reserves and the NIRC have benefited Singaporeans has been highlighted at various platforms, including the MOF website
[2]
and the CNA documentary on reserves.
[3]
NIRC, combined with operating revenue, form the total revenue that is used to meet annual public spending (i.e., the annual Budget), and contributes to the government's overall fiscal position. The NIRC has provided an annual revenue stream of about 3.5% of GDP on average over the past 5 years. No proportion of the NIRC is earmarked for specific spending items, or for transfer into any specific fund(s). Instead, a portion of the annual Budget as a whole may be used to top up funds. Hence, it is incorrect to state that most of the NIRC has been transferred into long term funds.
Furthermore, it is false to imply that moneys transferred into such long term funds do not contribute to 'actual spending'. Moneys transferred to all funds, including long term funds, contribute to the disbursements from such funds, and accordingly contribute to 'actual spending' which benefit Singaporeans. Moreover, how the moneys set aside for funds to support the Majulah Package, the Pioneer Generation Package, and the Merdeka Generation Package entail real spending has been previously clarified in a Factually article published on 30 August 2023 ' please see:

Second, the article claims that SLA had given preferential treatment to Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan by renting out 26 and 31 Ridout Road below market value while charging the Housing and Development Board (HDB) inflated prices for land.
This is untrue
.
Mr Jeyaretnam made similar false statements of fact in earlier publications that have already been clarified: see
https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually020823/
and
https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually300823-a/
He continues to make such statements with utter disregard for the facts. He repeatedly omitted the facts and clarifications, rather than provide them and let the readers draw their own conclusions. Mr Jeyaretnam's campaign of posting false statements misleads Singaporeans on the way that SLA works, as well as on the State's land sale and property rental policies.
As established in the review conducted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the rentals for both 26 and 31 Ridout Road were based on fair market value and not below market valuation. There was no evidence that the Minister's were given favourable rental rates due to their position. Details on how the market value was arrived at have been given in Parliament. The rental paid by the Minister's for both 26 and 31 Ridout Road were not less than the respective Guide Rents for the properties, which were determined by professional valuers, who adhered to established principles and methods for valuation. Indeed, the professional valuer from SLA who determined the Guide Rent for 26 Ridout Road did not know the identity of the prospective tenant for 26 Ridout Road at the material time, and only learnt that the tenant was Minister Shanmugam after the matter was reported in the media. It was also stated in Parliament that Minister Shanmugam had recused himself, in respect of the rental transaction. The CPIB had found that no preferential treatment was given to the Minister's and there was no evidence to suggest any abuse of position by the Minister's for personal gain.
SLA sells state land to HDB for the development of public housing at the fair market value. Fair market value is assessed by the Chief Valuer (and not SLA), who makes the professional assessment independently in accordance with established valuation principles. SLA does not charge HDB inflated prices for the land.
The underlying principle used by the Government for determining the value of land for sale to the public and for rental of the Ridout Road properties is the same - it is to transact at fair market value. Whether for short-term rental or longer-term sale, the valuation seeks to establish the price that the market is willing to pay in each case, so that the Government transacts at fair market value.
The matter of the rental of the Ridout Road properties had been independently and extensively investigated by CPIB and SM Teo Chee Hean. The facts have already been clarified and published. Please see:

Third, the article states that of $17 billion in healthcare expenditure, only $8 billion was used as subsidies for Singaporeans.
This is untrue.
There is no factual basis to state that of $17 billion in healthcare expenditure, only $8 billion was used as subsidies for Singaporeans.
For example, over the last three financial years, healthcare expenditure has ranged from $16.88 billion to $17.32 billion per year, and subsidies for Singaporeans have ranged from $9.54 billion to $10.93 billion per year. This is reflected in the
Government Budget Book
which is publicly available on the Ministry of Finance's website. Excluding COVID-19 expenditure which is transitory, more than 70% of total healthcare expenditure was spent on subsidies for Singaporeans.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Lawrence Wong, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue a Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his article and his Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X posts.
Additional Clarifications
The article also states that the Government uses '
subsidies from the Budget for HDB purchases to enable HDB to pay a higher price for land
' and that Singaporeans pay
'inflated prices for smaller and smaller HDB units'
. The following clarifications are necessary.
Land prices
State land is disposed of at fair market value (FMV). In the case of land for public housing, the FMV is independently and professionally determined by the Chief Valuer (CV), using market valuation principles.
The CV's valuation does not factor in housing subsidies or grants provided to HDB. The intent of housing subsidies is to keep flat prices affordable, and not to increase land price.
Pricing of BTO flats
HDB does not sell flats at 'inflated prices'. BTO flats are
not
priced based on cost, instead they are priced to ensure affordability. HDB first establishes the market value of the flats by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby, which is influenced by prevailing market conditions, as well as the individual attributes of the flats.
HDB then applies a significant subsidy to the assessed market values to ensure that new flats are affordable for flat buyers.
HDB flat sizes
HDB flats are designed to provide a living environment that is functional and comfortable. HDB flat sizes have not changed since 1997, but average household sizes have decreased.

Clarifications on the Security PWM
The Security PWM was first implemented in 2016 to provide career pathways, increase wages, and upskilling to improve the productivity of security officers. In 2021, the Government accepted the Security Tripartite Cluster (STC)'s recommendations on the review of the Security PWM, which included the following:
From 1 January 2024, the basic PWM wages for security officers will increase.
Full-time security officers will receive at least $2,650 in basic wages per month, compared to at least $1,650 in basic wages a month currently. By 2028, the basic wages for entry-level security officers will increase to $3,530, an increase of 33% from 2024.
This increased basic wage includes wages paid for extra hours worked above the standard 44-hour work week. However, the number of extra hours will continue to be capped at 72 hours per month under the Police Licensing and Regulatory Department (PLRD)'s licensing conditions, as opposed to the claims that officers will be asked to work up to 96 extra hours. This ensures security officers do not work excessive hours.
The new wage schedule assures security officers of sustainable wage growth without needing to clock excessive hours for a higher gross wage. They will be able to negotiate for better employment terms, including working hours, with their employers. The STC has never recommended a compulsory 72-hour work week for security officers.
The STC Report is available online at
www.ntuc.org.sg/tripartiteguidelines
The employment rights of security officers will continue to be protected under the Employment Act and PLRD's licensing conditions.
As security officers will be earning more than $2,600 per month, they will no longer be covered under Part 4 of the Employment Act, which covers the hours of work, rest days, and other conditions of services for lower-paying jobs.
However, security officers will continue to be protected by other parts of the Employment Act, including Part 10 on holidays, annual leave and sick leave entitlements. For more details on the Employment Act, please visit:
https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/employment-act/who-is-covered
MOM conducts proactive checks through audits and Workright inspections to educate employers and help them to comply with PWM requirements. Most firms follow the PWM requirements and firms with identified non-compliance are required to correct their practices.
If security officers believe that their employers are not following the Security PWM requirements and/or are not complying with the Employment Act, they are encouraged to engage their employers to clarify their doubts. If further help is needed, security officers can approach MOM for assistance at 6438 5122, or report Employment Act violation(s) at

MOM would also like to provide additional clarifications on other misleading points raised in Gutzy Asia's article and Facebook posts.
Background
On 12 October 2023, the Singapore Police Force had received a call for assistance at Block 874 Yishun Street 81. A woman was conveyed unconscious to the hospital, where she subsequently passed away.
False Statement of Fact
The articles and social media posts by Gutzy Asia, Singapore Eye and The Online Citizen Asia stated that the deceased individual was a female domestic worker from the Philippines.
This statement is false.
The deceased is a Singaporean.
POFMA Correction Direction
The Minister for Manpower has instructed for a Correction Direction, under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019, to be issued to Gutzy Asia, Singapore Eye and The Online Citizen Asia, which requires them to insert a Correction Notice against each original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.
We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours. The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of malicious falsehoods.
Additional clarifications
Gutzy Asia's article and Facebook posts had linked the death to 'urgent concerns about the wellbeing of domestic workers in Singapore amidst recent similar incidents', and stated that this 'spark[ed] calls for greater oversight and reforms to ensure their safety and wellbeing'. This is misleading, as it suggests that there has been insufficient oversight by the government over migrant domestic workers' (MDWs) well-being.
MOM has put in place a suite of measures to support the mental well-being of our MDWs.
Since April 2021, MOM officers have started house visits to engage some MDWs and their employers directly.
MOM officers are trained to look out for indicators of stress and discuss any issues raised with employers so that they can be adequately addressed.
Together with the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) under the National Trades Union Congress, MOM has launched three CDEConnect centres. The centres provide convenience for MDWs and their employers to walk in and seek advice on employment issues. The centres conduct compulsory interviews for all first-time MDWs to ensure they adapt well to their new role. MOM also works with other non-governmental organisations to extend our support measures.
In addition, within three months of the MDW's placement, employment agencies must conduct a post-placement check. All newly arrived MDWs also attend the Settling-In Programme, where they are taught how to work safely and carry out their duties responsibly.
Besides working with non-governmental organisations and employment agencies, MOM has also required first-time employers to attend the
Employers' Orientation Programme
(EOP). The EOP educates employers on their responsibilities of care towards their MDWs. Employers are reminded to be patient and understanding when guiding MDWs on their household chores, and to integrate them into the household.
MOM has also published a
mental well-being guide for employers
on our website. The guide highlights the signs and symptoms of stress; shares tips on how employers can help their MDWs adopt healthy habits; provides information on MDW courses and activities; and promotes helplines run by MOM, non-governmental and mental health organisations for distressed MDWs. MOM also regularly disseminates electronic mailers to advise and reiterate the key content in the mental well-being guide to employers.",4.335526,5.9625306,2023,0,Law & Order (Read: Police),Gutzy Asia; The Online Citizen
2023-09-13,Corrections regarding false statements in Plan B's Spotify podcast interview with James Raj and other related posts on Instagram published on 6 and 7,False statements in Plan B's podcast interview with James Raj,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually130923-a/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/41e3dbe0-ef44-45b5-8284-1ee28cca6f39/man-typing-laptop.jpg,"The Ministry of Home Affairs ('MHA'), Ministry of Law ('MinLaw') and Ministry of Defence ('MINDEF') are aware of three podcast episodes (#614, #615, #616) by Plan B on Spotify, in which James Raj Arokiasamy ('James Raj') had made several false statements. Some of these false statements were also reproduced on Plan B's Instagram on 7 Sep 2023.
Background
James Raj was a hacker who went by the pseudonym 'The Messiah' and who claimed to be part of the hacktivist group, 'Anonymous'. He was behind a number of hacking incidents in late 2013. The following summarises James Raj's history of brushes with the law, and how it relates to the falsehoods in the next section of this article:
On 25 May 2011, James Raj was arrested for drug offences. While on bail, James Raj absconded from Singapore and fled to Malaysia.
James Raj committed acts of computer misuse between Mar and Nov 2013 while on the run in Malaysia.
On 4 Nov 2013, James Raj was arrested in Malaysia for drug offences and repatriated to Singapore. He was eventually sentenced to 4 years and 8 months' imprisonment in 2015 for offences under the then-Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act ('CMCA') and the Misuse of Drugs Act ('MDA').
James Raj served a total of 3 years in prison from 3 Dec 2013 to 16 Dec 2016, of which 2 years were under remand due to his refusal to cooperate with investigations.
After James Raj was released, he was involved in another incident on 29 Nov 2021 where he got into an altercation with a drunk customer in a shop. He was arrested for the offence of affray, and was eventually issued a stern warning for causing hurt.

Falsehoods and Facts
The Spotify podcast episodes and the related videos on Instagram falsely state the following:
#1 Falsehood: The Singapore authorities did not press charges against James Raj out of fear of retaliation.
Fact
: On 29 Nov 2021, James Raj was involved in a dispute at a shop with another customer who was drunk and shouting at the shop assistant. James Raj was assaulted in the process and suffered a nasal fracture. A scuffle ensued, and subsequently James Raj kicked the subject. James Raj was only issued a stern warning, in lieu of prosecution, for the following reasons:
He was not the aggressor;
He suffered a more serious injury than the other party;
He had no violent antecedents; and
He had readily admitted to kicking the other party.
It was not due to fear of retaliation as James Raj had claimed. The Police are fair and balanced in dealing with cases, even if the protagonist has criminal antecedents. If James Raj's involvement had been more egregious, he would have been charged and prosecuted in court.
#2 Falsehood: For the period of two to three years when he was in remand, James Raj was isolated and deprived of human interaction (except with his warden).
Fact
: James Raj's description of his time in remand is entirely baseless. James Raj was housed with other inmates during his remand period, save for one occasion when he was housed in an isolation cell between 28 and 30 Mar 2014 for having committed prison disciplinary offences. During his remand period, he received regular visits from his family members such as his mother and sister, and corresponded with them via letters. He saw his lawyers in prison on at least 12 occasions.
#3 Falsehood: James Raj was arrested and imprisoned for protesting the regulation of Internet censorship.
Fact:
James Raj was wanted by Singaporean authorities for absconding from bail after he was arrested for drug offences. He was subsequently arrested in Malaysia for the drug offences, and repatriated to Singapore.
He was not, as he now claims, arrested for protesting the regulation of Internet censorship. Subsequently, he was charged for the drug offences and then-CMCA offences. 
#4 Falsehood: The Government offered James Raj a plea deal where he would plead guilty to 39 charges instead of proceeding to trial on over 400 charges in order to cover up the fact that he was able to hack into the systems of many government agencies.
Fact:
James
Raj was not served with 400+ charges. He was served a total of 161 charges (158 charges under then-CMCA and three charges under the MDA) and signed all 161 charge sheets. The 161 charges were not amalgamated.
The Prosecution proceeded on 40 charges, of which 39 charges were under then-CMCA and one charge under the MDA. The remaining charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This approach is consistent with the Prosecution's practice of proceeding on only a proportion of the charges, should an accused person elect to plead guilty instead of claiming trial. This avoids expending judicial resources unnecessarily.
The systems which James Raj managed to hack into were disclosed publicly in the charges and Statement of Facts to which James Raj had pleaded guilty.
#5 Falsehood: James Raj had hacked into Singapore Land Authority's ('SLA') systems in 2013.
Fact:
There is no evidence of any breach into SLA's systems by James Raj. Investigations established that James Raj had scanned SLA's servers for vulnerabilities but he did not hack, successfully or otherwise, into SLA's systems
.
This is consistent with admissions from James Raj himself.
#6 Falsehood: James Raj had hacked into
MINDEF's systems.
Fact:
The Spotify podcast episode #614, and its related Instagram Posts featured James Raj making the statement that he had hacked into MINDEF systems. MINDEF's cyber and security agencies confirm that MINDEF's systems have never been breached by James Raj.
POFMA Correction Direction
The Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Law has instructed for a Correction Direction, under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, to be issued to Plan B, which requires Plan B to insert a notice against each original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.
We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours. The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of malicious falsehoods.
Additional clarifications
James Raj committed acts of computer misuse between Mar and Nov 2013 while on the run in Malaysia. When he was arrested, his activities were fully investigated leading to a total of 161 charges. It was not a case of allowing himself to be caught as he has suggested in the podcast. He was eventually dealt with in accordance with the law for his crimes.
MHA is aware that James Raj had posted several videos on TikTok which contained additional falsehoods and allegations against the Singapore Police Force ('SPF') and Singapore Prison Service ('SPS'). They are untrue and we understand that TikTok has banned James Raj's TikTok account, @jamesmessiah, and the videos are no longer accessible. On claims by James Raj that he was beaten up when arrested, MHA notes that James Raj had lodged a Police report on 5 Nov 2013 about the manner of his arrest the day before in Malaysia, and he had claimed to have been assaulted by the Royal Malaysian Police ('RMP'). Based on the statements of the eight SPF and Central Narcotics Bureau ('CNB') officers involved in his arrest, none had witnessed any occurrence of mistreatment or assault by RMP officers.
SPF and SPS officers did not assault him nor deny him any medical treatment when he was in custody or in prison. James Raj was treated professionally and fairly, no different from other accused persons or inmates.
Separately, MINDEF had issued a statement on 11 Sep 2023 which clarified that MINDEF's systems were neither hacked nor compromised as claimed by James Raj. Please click

2023-09-13,Corrections regarding false statements of fact in article and post published by East Asia Forum on 18 August 2023,,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually130923-b/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/b54d9f53-ad50-4ca6-8660-052bfc214856/aerial-view-singapore-1.jpg,"1. The Prime Minister's Office would like to point out that the article published on 18 August 2023 by the East Asia Forum on their website and shared on their Facebook page contains false statements of fact.
False statements of fact
2. First, the article makes the statements that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (PM Lee) conflated marital infidelity and corruption, and he equated the three issues the People's Action Party (PAP) had faced
[1]
with the Workers' Party's (WP) one episode of marital infidelity. This is
untrue
.
3. PM Lee did not conflate marital infidelity and corruption.
At the press conference on 17 July 2023, PM Lee gave his views in relation to both the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) investigations and extra-marital affairs pursuant to a question posed to him by the media. Any concurrent mention of both the CPIB investigations and extra-marital affairs related only to the close proximity of the timing in which the incidents were made public, and not the substance of these incidents.
PM Lee made clear in his Ministerial Statement on 2 August 2023 that the Government took different approaches towards allegations of corruption or other wrongdoing in the discharge of official duties on the one hand, and cases involving misconduct in personal lives on the other hand.
Furthermore, PM Lee made two references to the WP in his 2 August 2023 Ministerial Statement and clarifications to the same
[2]
, none of which were attempts to equate the three issues the PAP faced with the WP's one episode of marital infidelity. PM Lee's Ministerial Statement can be found in the
Official Report (Hansard) for the Parliament sitting on 2 August 2023
.
Second, the article conveys that: (a) CPIB is not independent in deciding whether to carry out investigations because it reports directly to the Prime Minister alone; and (b) the Prime Minister alone has the power to refuse approval for CPIB to investigate. This is also
untrue
.
CPIB reports directly to the Prime Minister, in that it is accountable to the Prime Minister. CPIB, like all other agencies, has to be accountable to somebody. A state agency cannot operate without any oversight or governance.
However, the article omits to mention the other safeguards that have been put in place to ensure CPIB's independence:
CPIB is not legally required to seek the consent of the Prime Minister before conducting its investigations.
Investigations can proceed, unless the Prime Minister indicates that he does not consent to any particular investigation or that he would like the investigation to stop.
Even if the Prime Minister indicates that he does not consent to a particular investigation or that he would like a particular investigation to stop, Article 22G of the Constitution enables CPIB to continue with the investigation with the concurrence of the President.
There are also Constitutional safeguards for the appointment or the revocation of the appointment of the Director of CPIB, which may be refused by the President in his/her own discretion.
Third, the article conveys that there was a cover-up of wrongdoing or corruption in having only former Minister Richard Hu speak with M/s Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong, in relation to their purchase of properties from Hotel Properties Ltd. This is
untrue
.
This matter was openly debated in Parliament in 1996. The full facts were disclosed in Ministerial Statements, and there was a full debate on the matter. During the debate, MPs who spoke, including then-Opposition MPs Low Thia Khiang, Ling How Doong, Cheo Chai Chen, and Chiam See Tong did not state that there was anything wrong with the discounts that then-SM and then-DPM received.
In addition, investigations were conducted by then-PM Goh, then-Minister for Finance Richard Hu, and then-Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Koh Beng Seng at the material time.
MAS' investigations did not disclose any wrongdoing or impropriety by M/s Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong or reveal any evidence that would call for the application of section 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960.
Then-PM Goh also explained that 'CPIB had also received two anonymous letters of complaints on HPL's method of 'soft launch' of its properties. But as no corruption was alleged, it referred the letters to MAS.'
Finally, the article conveys that there was a cover-up of wrongdoing or corruption by allegedly having only Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, and not CPIB, investigate the matter concerning SLA's lease of state-owned properties at Ridout Road to Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.
This is
untrue
.
The two Minister's had asked the Prime Minister for an independent investigation into their respective rentals of the Ridout Road properties, and the Prime Minister had tasked CPIB to do the investigation.
CPIB investigated into the matter and produced a report after a thorough factual investigation. Its report stated that it found no evidence of corruption or wrongdoing in the rental transactions of the Ridout Road properties.
Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also reviewed the matter (relying on CPIB's investigation findings), to establish whether proper processes had been followed, and if there had been any wrongdoing. His report concluded that both the Minister's and the public officers, as well as private sector intermediaries involved, conducted themselves properly in the rental transactions of the Ridout Road properties. Both reports were ordered by the Prime Minister to be published.
The investigations, findings, facts and related matters were discussed openly in Parliament in July 2023, during which MPs raised questions and sought clarifications. MPs from both sides of the House did not dispute CPIB's findings.
The sitting was telecast live and the proceedings, investigations, findings, facts and related matters were widely reported.
PM Lee has made the Government's stance very clear ' to keep our system clean and incorruptible, the Government will carry through what needs to be done in accordance with the law, no matter the embarrassment or political cost. Where there have been allegations of wrongdoing, these have been investigated and the findings reported to the public. Where wrongdoing has been found, the Government has acted decisively.
Whilst the author is free to express his views on the above matters, his article makes false and misleading statements while omitting key facts on these matters of public interest.
Hence, the Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Ms Indranee Rajah, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the East Asia Forum in respect of the article on their website and their Facebook post. The Correction Direction requires the recipient to insert a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours.

[2] The two references are as follows:
PM Lee made a personal plea that whilst Mr Tan, Ms Cheng Li Hui, and a former WP Member of Parliament (MP), had behaved improperly, there are also innocent family members involved who are suffering. PM Lee hoped that MPs and the public could empathise and have compassion for the families, and give them the privacy and space they needed to heal; and
PM Lee mentioned in response to a clarification by Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh that the PAP establishes its own standards and practices, and the WP will have to decide and account to Singaporeans for its practices.",3.7161465,6.927998,2023,5,"Governance (Read: Election, Policies)",East Asia Forum

Please note that any mark outside the boxes will be disregarded.
In the unlikely event the self-inking stamp runs out of ink, the Presiding Officer (PO) will replace it with a new self-inking stamp.
From GE2025 onwards, the area for marking has also been enlarged to make it easier for voters to mark their choice within the designated area.
Voters who may have difficulty using the self-inking stamp can approach the PO to assist in marking the ballot paper, as POs are bound by the oath of secrecy and will not divulge the vote.

False statements of fact
Mr Jeyaretnam has made several false statements.
Majulah Package, Pioneer Generation Package, and Merdeka Generation Package disbursements
The article states that the Government does not expect to fully disburse to the intended beneficiaries the moneys set aside for funds to support the Majulah Package, the Pioneer Generation Package, and the Merdeka Generation Package disbursements.
This is untrue
.
The Government has set aside moneys for funds to support the Majulah Package, the Pioneer Generation Package, and the Merdeka Generation Package (collectively, '
the Packages
') in order to fund specific disbursements as regards the Packages. The Government projects and has always remained committed to the full disbursement of the moneys in the funds towards the Packages.
The moneys for the funds are to meet the important long-term spending commitment towards the Packages, so that the Packages will be funded without burdening future generations.
The moneys set aside therefore entail real spending to support the Packages.
Manpower statistics
The article stated that as long as a person is a full-time student, that person will be considered employed in Singapore's manpower statistics.
This is false.
Not every full-time student is, by default, regarded as 'employed' in Singapore's manpower statistics. Whether a full-time student is considered to be employed depends on whether the person is working while studying.
The article stated that the recent Labour Force Participation Rate for Singapore citizens is a low figure at below 50%.
This is false.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey shows that the Labour Force Participation Rate
1
for Singapore citizens over the past five years has consistently stayed well above 50%. In 2022, it was 68.3%.
Chart 1: Labour Force Participation Rate among Singapore citizens
Singapore's Labour Force Participation Rate (68.3% for Singapore citizens and 70% for residents in 2022) is very high compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. By way of comparison, the 2022 Labour Force Participation Rate is 62.9% in the United Kingdom, 62.2% in the United States and 61.3% in Germany.
Chart 2: Labour Force Participation Rate (%) in Singapore and in OECD countries, 2022
Note: The Labour Force Participation Rates for residents and citizens in Singapore are extracted from MOM's statistics. For the OECD countries, the data are extracted from
https://data.oecd.org/emp/labour-force-participation-rate.htm
.
The MOM does not usually break down resident labour force statistics into statistics for Singapore citizens and permanent residents. This is because Singapore citizens make up a large majority of the resident labour force, at about 85%. The permanent resident population has also remained stable over time. These two facts taken together mean that for the most part, resident data mirrors citizen data, and having citizen data in addition to resident data provides little additional information. For Singapore, the Labour Force Participation Rate for residents (at 70.0%) is also close to the rate for citizens (at 68.3%). Please visit

 for more information on our labour force.
Ridout Road
Mr Jeyaretnam continues to issue false statements relating to the rental of properties from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA). He seeks to mislead the public despite some of his falsehoods having been clarified and debunked after the investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and statements in Parliament.
In his article and posts, Mr Jeyaretnam makes the statement that SLA rented out 26 and 31 Ridout Road at the rentals it did, because Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan were going to be its tenants and Minister Shanmugam controlled SLA.
This is untrue
.
He made a similar false statement of fact in an earlier publication that has already been clarified: see
https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually020823/
.
The rentals for both 26 and 31 Ridout Road were based on market value. Details on how the market value was arrived at have been given in Parliament. The two properties were also vacant for some years, before they were rented out to the two Minister's. It was also stated in Parliament that Minister Shanmugam had recused himself, in respect of his rental transaction.
Mr Jeyaretnam's article and posts also make the statement that the Government uses the principle of market value to value land for sale to the public, but it did not do so for renting out the land that was part of the 26 Ridout Road property.
This is untrue.
The underlying principle used by the Government for determining the value of land for sale to the public and land for rental (including rental of the land that was part of the 26 Ridout Road property) is the same ' it is to transact at fair market value. Whether for short-term rental or a longer-term sale, the valuation seeks to establish the price that the market is willing to pay in each case, so that the Government transacts at fair market value.
Next, the article, Facebook, X and LinkedIn posts make the statement that SLA allowed Minister Shanmugam to annex additional land to the property he rented.
This is untrue. The facts were made clear in Parliament.
 Finally, the article, Facebook, X and LinkedIn posts make the statement that Senior Minister Teo said in Parliament that the additional cleared land of 26 Ridout Road was virtually valueless.
This is untrue
.
Senior Minister Teo made no such statement in Parliament. He had explained at length that the Guide Rent was assessed by professional valuers. He had also referred to Minister Edwin Tong's explanation on how market value was arrived at.
Money laundering and foreign tax evasion
Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam falsely stated that the Government deliberately does not take action against money laundering and foreign tax evasion, allowing huge inflows of 'dirty money' into Singapore. This is untrue. Where an offence is disclosed and the Government has sufficient basis to act, it does so. The Government has in place policies and a robust and comprehensive regulatory framework to counter money laundering, which are tightly supervised and enforced.
Financial institutions and other designated entities are required to implement anti-money laundering measures, such as customer due diligence checks.
Suspicious transaction reports are also analysed by the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office, to detect money laundering and other serious crimes. Where possible offences are detected, the financial intelligence is disseminated to relevant enforcement and regulatory agencies for follow-up. Recently, extensive investigations and follow-up from intelligence, including the analysis of Suspicious Transaction Reports, contributed to an island-wide anti-money laundering operation by the Police on 15 August 2023. This operation resulted in the arrest of 10 foreign nationals and about $1bn in cash and assets being seized, frozen or issued with prohibition of disposal orders.
The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 ('
CDSA'
) was amended over the years, with the latest amendments being passed by Parliament in 2023, to strengthen our ability to enforce against and prosecute offences relating to money laundering and tax evasion. The CDSA provides for the confiscation of benefits derived from a wide range of criminal conduct, including foreign tax evasion offences.
The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue a Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnamin respect of his article, Facebook post, X post and LinkedIn post.
Additional clarifications
GST Voucher Fund disbursements
The top-ups to the GST Voucher (GSTV) Fund demonstrate the Government's commitment to set aside additional resources to flow higher levels of support to Singaporeans during this period of higher inflation, and to cushion the impact of the new GST rates.
The GSTV Fund funds both the Assurance Package (AP) and the permanent GSTV scheme. The AP runs from FY2022 to FY2026. The GSTV scheme is a permanent scheme that has been running since 2012. Singaporeans have already been receiving both types of payouts. Further enhancements to both the AP and permanent GSTV scheme were made in Budget 2023. The Government expects to disburse the bulk of the funds in the GSTV Fund (balance of $9.3 billion as at 31 March 2023) over the next five years.
Reserves
The Government is committed to meeting the needs of Singaporeans. The reserves support Singapore's current spending needs through its contribution to the annual Budget. About one-fifth of Government spending is funded by the investment returns of our reserves through the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), and the NIRC has provided an annual revenue stream of about 3.5% of GDP on average over the past 5 years. For the financial year which ended on 31 March 2023, the NIRC was about $22.4 billion.
The reserves also serve as our crisis fund. During the Global Financial Crisis and across FY2020 to FY2022 in our fight against COVID-19, our reserves helped us to weather crises without having to incur debt that will have to be borne by future generations. The total draw on past reserves for COVID-19 response measures across FY2020 to FY2022 was about $40 billion. By tapping on the reserves, the Government was able to fund public health measures as well as economic and social support measures, in order to save lives and protect livelihoods.
Government support for unemployed workers
The article also stated that the Government's financial support for unemployed workers announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally 2023 is not intended to help them find jobs but to keep them from being counted as unemployed. This is untrue.
The Prime Minister had stated at the National Day Rally 2023 that the aim of the Government's financial support for workers who lose their jobs is to 'ease the immediate pressure that jobseekers experience so they can focus on upgrading their skills for a better long-term job'.
As with any other Government support for training or reskilling, the Government's objective is to improve workers' skills and employability which would translate to better employment outcomes for them. For example, about 9 in 10 individuals placed through Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programmes remained employed 24 months after placement. In addition, about 6 in 10 individuals who went through SkillsFuture Singapore's train-and-place programmes during the pandemic found employment within 6 months of completing the training.
Pricing of BTO flats
HDB does not price BTO flats for cost recovery. HDB's flat pricing approach is totally separate and independent from the BTO projects' development costs.
Instead, BTO flats are priced with generous subsidies such that they remain affordable to Singaporeans across different income levels. The difference in prices between the comparable resale flats and subsidised BTO flats broadly reflects the subsidies provided for BTO flats, after accounting for differences in attributes and tenure.
HDB flat sizes
HDB flats are designed to provide a living environment that is functional and comfortable. HDB flat sizes have not changed since 1997, but average household sizes have decreased.
Members of the public are advised not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours.

2023-08-24,Corrections regarding falsehoods on public housing policies,Falsehoods that claim HDB prices and sells BTO flats to make a profit,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually240823-a/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/7335cfd7-6f63-409d-89a7-a4ca5ecdc6fb/HDB-housing-skyline.jpg,"The Ministry of National Development (MND) would like to point out that the videos posted by TikTok user 'dr.ishhaq.jay' on 17 and 18 August 2023 (collectively '
the Videos
') contain false statements of fact regarding public housing policies.
False statements of fact
1. The video posted on 17 August 2023 stated that HDB prices and sells BTO flats to make a profit. This statement is
false
.
Facts:
HDB does
not
price and sell BTO flats to make a profit.
Unlike private sector developers which are profit-driven, HDB prices new flats with the objective of keeping public housing affordable to help Singaporeans own their homes.
To determine housing affordability, HDB looks at the resident household incomes, and compares them with the range of flat types and selling prices on offer at every BTO launch.
In pricing new BTO flats, HDB establishes the market value of the flats by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby, and then applies a significant market discount to the assessed market values, to ensure BTO flats are affordable for flat buyers. Tiered housing grants are offered by HDB, providing targeted help to those who need it the most.
More information on HDB's pricing approach can be found in the
MND-HDB media statement dated 7 December 2022
.
2. The video posted on 18 August 2023 stated that HDB makes a profit from selling BTO flats. This statement is
false.
Facts:
HDB does
not
make a profit from selling BTO flats.
The amount collected from the sale of HDB flats in every financial year is less than the total development cost, which includes land and construction costs, and CPF housing grants disbursed to eligible homebuyers. In the last three years (FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022), HDB incurred a deficit of about S$2.68 billion per year.
3. The video posted on 18 August 2023 stated that SLA charges a premium when selling land used for HDB flats, and that SLA makes profits from land sold to HDB. These statements are
false
.
Facts:
State land is sold to HDB for the development of public housing at the fair market value assessed by the Chief Valuer, not SLA, who makes the professional assessment independently based on well-accepted and established valuation principles.
State land is part of the reserves and is not owned by SLA. As such, when state land is sold to HDB, the value paid by HDB accrues to the reserves and not to SLA.
When state land is sold at fair market value to HDB, there is no increase in the value of the reserves. Neither are the reserves made worse-off or diminished. It is a conversion of one type of asset (land) to another (cash).
The Minister for National Development has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the TikTok user 'dr.ishhaq.jay' in respect of his posts, and a Targeted Correction Direction to TikTok Pte. Ltd. The Directions require recipients to insert a notice, with a link to the Government's clarification.
Additional Clarifications
MND is aware that the user has published a number of videos on these topics.
1. The videos claimed that HDB has factored in land costs into BTO flats.
Facts:
HDB does
not
price flats to recover cost (including land cost and construction cost). BTO flats are priced for affordability.
Unlike private developers who adopt a profit-based pricing approach for private residential developments to cater for a profit margin on top of development costs, HDB's flat pricing approach is totally separate and independent from the BTO projects' development costs.
Instead, HDB prices new flats with affordability in mind. More information on HDB's pricing approach can be found in the
MND-HDB media statement dated 7 December 2022
.
2. The videos claimed that HDB has not disclosed the cost of building flats.
Facts:
The cost of building HDB flats is
publicly available and disclosed every year
in
HDB's annual report
and financial statements. Construction costs are also published on HDB's website and GeBIZ when the tender results are announced.
3. The videos claimed that the Government does not give a solution for Singaporeans to afford housing, after their monies get channelled for retirement purposes.
Facts:
The CPF system, especially CPF contribution rates, has evolved to take into account housing needs, namely to help Singaporeans own homes.
CPF contributions that are channelled to a member's CPF Ordinary Account can be used for housing.
As described above, HDB ensures that prices of new flats are affordable. 90% of flat buyers who collected their keys from HDB in 1H2022 used 25% or less of their monthly income to service their HDB loan instalment payments. This means that these flat buyers can service the loans using their CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay.
Even so, there are Singaporeans who may be stretched. For those who face difficulties paying the monthly instalments of their HDB housing loan, HDB has in place financial assistance measures, such as deferring or reducing the monthly loan instalments for 6 months.
There are some older Singaporeans, especially those who bought a resale flat or bought a flat later in life, who still have to service housing loans. Members can continue to use their Ordinary Account monies for housing beyond the age of 55. More information can be found in the

2023-08-22,Corrections regarding false statements of fact in posts published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 18 August 2023,,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually220823-a/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/9782fa0c-51fb-4e80-bb6c-c3c267b13727/cbd-singapore-office.jpg,"The Ministry of Law would like to point out that the Facebook post and X (formerly known as 'Twitter') post published on 18 August 2023 by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam contain false statements of fact.
False statements of fact
First, the Facebook and X posts make the statement that the arrests of 10 foreign nationals on 15 August 2023 for forgery and money laundering offences were a result of China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and China's pressure on Singapore.
This is untrue.
As stated in the Police News Release dated 16 August 2023 ('Ten Foreign Nationals To Be Charged For Offences Including Forgery And Money Laundering With An Estimated Value Of About One Billion In Cash And Various Assets Seized, Frozen Or Issued With Prohibition Of Disposal Orders'), the Police had identified the suspects through intelligence probes and extensive investigations including the analysis of Suspicious Transaction Reports. These operations and the planning of the arrests had been in the works over many months. They were not at the behest or because of any foreign party. No foreign parties had been informed of these cases before the arrests.
Second, the Facebook post makes the statement that the CPIB probe into Minister S Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng was a result of foreign pressure.
This is also untrue
.
CPIB was investigating a separate matter, and came across some information concerning Minister Iswaran. It then looked into the matter.
CPIB's investigation into Minister Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng was not due to foreign pressure.
These facts were stated publicly on multiple occasions, including:
PM's and Minister Chan Chun Sing's statements in Parliament on 2 August 2023.
CPIB's Press Release dated 12 July 2023.
PM's statement dated 12 July 2023, and DPM's doorstop interview on 12 July 2023.
Third, the Facebook post makes the statement that the rental rates paid by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for 26 and 31 Ridout Road, respectively, are locked in over nine years.
This is untrue
.
The rental rates paid by the Minister's for the Ridout properties were not locked in over nine years. The tenancies are renewable every two / three years, and the rentals are likewise to be reviewed, based on prevailing market value. When the tenancies of the two properties were up for renewal after the initial three years, a revaluation was carried out by professional valuers to peg the rentals to the prevailing market rate. This valuation was based on market comparables.
The property at 26 Ridout Road was renewed in June 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, for three years with the rent maintained at $26,500 per month.
The property at 31 Ridout Road was renewed in October 2022 for three years with the rent increased to $20,000 per month, from $19,000 per month.
These facts were stated in publicly available materials, including:
The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) report dated 23 June 2023 and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean's review report dated 26 June 2023, as subsequently reiterated and explained at the 3 July Parliament sitting during the Ministerial Statements and subsequent clarifications.
More information on the facts relating to the rental of 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road can be found in the
Official Report (Hansard) for the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2023
.
The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong, has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue a Correction Direction
[1]
to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his Facebook post and X post.
Additional Clarifications
In the same Facebook post, Mr Jeyaretnam alleged that 'it took proof from German courts about F1's Ecclestone paying bribes and a UK HMRC investigation into his tax issues involving a Singapore bank, for the bank to be overhauled and three other Singapore financial institutions with it.'
These assertions are untrue. Earlier this month, DPM Lawrence Wong had provided information on the facts, in response to Parliamentary Questions 4899 and 4938. His response can be found in the
Official Report (Hansard) for the Parliament sitting on 2 August 2023
. We highlight the following:
First, Singapore proactively shared information with the UK authorities, to help them develop their case against Mr Bernie Ecclestone. As early as 2017, MAS conducted an inspection of the bank cited in recent media reports, to assess its controls for mitigating money laundering and terrorist financing risks. This was about five years before Mr Ecclestone was eventually charged by the UK authorities in 3Q 2022.
Second, while MAS found that there was room for improvement in the bank's anti-money laundering processes, it did not find gaps or weaknesses that were systemic in nature. MAS also noted that when adverse news about Mr Ecclestone first surfaced in 2013, the bank promptly subjected the account to enhanced monitoring controls by requiring all transactions to be flagged for scrutiny and approval.
The bank addressed the specific areas identified for improvement as required. This did not amount to an 'overhaul' which in the ordinary meaning of the word, would suggest that a thorough remake, renewal or revision had been necessary.
Members of the public are advised not to speculate, spread unverified rumours, and/or exaggerate facts.

the TikTok Post
') on 12 August 2023 contains a false statement of fact on CPF members.
False Statement of Fact
The TikTok Post stated that no one among low- and middle-income CPF members who has used their CPF monies to repay their HDB loan has been able to meet either the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) or Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in their CPF accounts.
This statement is
false
.
Based on CPF Board's data, almost 7 in 10 active CPF members have set aside their cohort's BRS at age 55 in 2022. This proportion includes members earning below the median income for those aged 55 years old in 2022 who have used their CPF savings to repay housing loans. We expect the proportion of active CPF members who are able to set aside their cohort's BRS at age 55 to increase to about 8 in 10 in 2027.

Ltd. under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019, in respect of the TikTok Post.
Additional Clarifications
Government Support for Retirement Adequacy
The Government has been enhancing the CPF system over the years, especially to benefit those who require more support. For example, we provide 1% extra interest on the first $60,000 of members' combined CPF balances, and an additional 1% on the first $30,000 of combined CPF balances for members aged 55 and above, to help boost their retirement savings.
To help seniors who wish to continue working, we have been raising senior workers' CPF contribution rates in tandem with the raising of retirement and re-employment age. For seniors who have less for retirement, we provide targeted support through schemes such as
Silver Support
and
ComCare
. We have also introduced the
Matched Retirement Savings Scheme
to help seniors who have not met the prevailing BRS to save more for retirement.
To support lower-wage workers to earn more through upgrading skills and improving productivity, the Government has worked with tripartite partners to expand the
Progressive Wage Model
. The Government further tops up their wages and provides additional CPF contributions through the
Workfare Income Supplement scheme
.
Clarifications on TikTok Post
The TikTok Post claimed that members will have to start paying cash for their monthly HDB loan repayment from age 55 onwards, as CPF monies in their Ordinary Account would all be transferred to their Retirement Account at that point.
Facts:
When a CPF member turns 55, monies from the member's Special Account is transferred to their Retirement Account, up to the Full Retirement Sum. If there is a shortfall to the Full Retirement Sum, only the Ordinary Account monies needed to make up the shortfall is transferred to the Retirement Account.
CPF members can apply before age 55 to have all or part of their Ordinary Account monies retained in their Ordinary Account to pay for their housing loan. If they do so, this monies will
not
be transferred to the Retirement Account even if there is a shortfall to the Full Retirement Sum.
Any inflows to members' Ordinary Account after they turn 55 can also be used for housing.
Please visit the CPF Board
website
for more details.
The TikTok Post claimed that members are charged interest on the CPF monies and grants used for housing.
Facts:
When members use their CPF savings for housing, they are tapping into savings that go towards supporting their retirement needs, Therefore, when they
sell their property
, they are required to refund to their own CPF Account the total amount of CPF monies (including any CPF housing grants) used for the purchase of the flat as well as the amount of interest the member would have earned if that monies were not utilised for the purchase of the flat. The full refund goes to the member's CPF account, and nothing goes to the Government or any other party. There are no charges imposed on the member when they sell their property.
The TikTok Post claimed that members cannot use their CPF savings to pay for their children's education, whereas foreigners enjoy education for free.
Facts:
Under the
CPF Education Loan Scheme
, CPF members can use their Ordinary Account savings to pay for their children's tuition fees at full-time subsidised diploma/degree courses at Approved Educational Institutions.
In general, foreigners pay higher school fees than Singaporeans, and do not get education for free in Singapore. Access to government loans is also not free for foreign students, with interest payable after graduation.

The statement is
untrue
for the following reasons
The Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 ('
PEA
'), and the equivalent provisions of its predecessor Acts, provide for voting secrecy. The Government (including ELD) has complied strictly with the statutory procedures and obligations relating to voting secrecy, as a matter of policy and practice.
The statutory procedures and obligations to protect voting secrecy are rigorous and comprehensive. For example, every officer, clerk, interpreter, candidate and agent authorised to attend at a polling station or at the counting of votes must, before so attending, make an oath of secrecy.
Another set of statutory procedures provide that, for votes cast in person at polling stations, there is no break in the chain of custody of ballot papers transported from the polling stations to the counting centres, and from the counting centres to the Supreme Court. The ballot papers would be sealed before they are retained in safe custody at the Supreme Court for six months and subsequently destroyed. This process is transparent and open to observation by candidates and their agents.
The serial number on the ballot paper is meant to protect the integrity of the electoral process. It enables accounting of all ballot papers issued and cast, and safeguards against counterfeiting and voter impersonation. Calling out the voter's serial number and name also allows polling agents, who are observing the proceedings, to validate that the voters are listed in their copy of the register.
When the ballot paper is issued, the voter serial number is written on the ballot paper counterfoil to facilitate vote tracing, if necessary, e.g., if there are allegations that the vote was fraudulently cast. However, inspection of the sealed votes is allowed
only
with an order from the General Division of the High Court, and such an order can only be made in limited circumstances. The Judge hearing the application must be satisfied that the inspection is required for the purposes of instituting or maintaining a prosecution or an application under Section 90 of the PEA, which seeks to void an election on certain limited grounds, including breaches of the PEA that affected the election result or corrupt or illegal practices committed in the election by a candidate.
Therefore, the Government cannot trace who a voter has voted for, as it wishes.

False statement of fact
The Posts make the statement that SLA charged Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan rent at below market value for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road.
This is untrue
. As established in the review conducted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the rental paid by both Minister's were at fair market value and not below market valuation. There was no evidence that the Minister's were given favourable rental rates due to their positions.
The rental paid by the Minister's for both 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were not less than the respective Guide Rents for the properties. A Guide Rent must be calculated for all State properties available for rent and is the key mechanism through which the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) ensures that State properties are rented out at fair market value. The Guide Rents are determined by professional valuers.  These are either valuers from SLA's independent valuation team or valuers appointed by professional third-party Managing Agents. Valuers adhere to established principles and methods for valuation. In determining the Guide Rents, the valuers take into account factors such as location, use, floor area, physical condition of the property and prevailing market conditions. In general, reference is made to rentals of comparable properties.
For 26 Ridout Road, a professional valuer from SLA determined the Guide Rent for the site, including the adjacent land to the site ('
Adjacent Land
'). The SLA valuer did not know the identity of the prospective tenant for 26 Ridout Road at the material time, and only learnt that the tenant was Minister Shanmugam after the matter was reported in the media. The market practice is for the rental valuation of such residential properties to be based primarily on the Gross Floor Area of the property, and the valuation of the rental in respect of 26 Ridout Road followed established market practice. The rent per unit floor area for 26 Ridout Road was the third highest, when compared to that of the other nine Black and White bungalows in the Ridout Road Estate which were tenanted out in 2018.
As Minister Shanmugam had stated in his interview with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and explained in Parliament, he had not wanted to lease the Adjacent Land as there would be legal obligations attached to leasing it. However, SLA's preference was to include the Adjacent Land within the property boundary of 26 Ridout Road. That would make it clear that the responsibility for maintaining the Adjacent Land would fall on the tenant, as would the legal obligations, for example, the tenant would be responsible for any mosquito breeding. SLA thus negotiated an agreement in which the Adjacent Land would be included within the property boundary, with the tenant responsible for maintaining it. For completeness, Minister Shanmugam incurred the cost of maintaining the Adjacent Land, which would otherwise be borne by SLA.

False statements of fact
First, the post makes the statement that the State paid for the renovations to 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road because the properties were leased by Minister's Shanmugam and Balakrishnan.
This is untrue
. The identity of the tenants had no bearing on the decision on the works to be carried out on the properties. The post omits important information that the works done were in keeping with Singapore Land Authority's (SLA) practice, and were assessed to be necessary in the circumstances, as explained by the Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong in Parliament on 3 July 2023.
SLA invests a significant amount in maintaining conserved properties, which include 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. SLA has spent similar, or even larger, amounts on other Black and White bungalows, consistent with conservation requirements (see
Annex A
). Most of the costs incurred for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were for works that external consultants had determined to be necessary, in light of the condition of the properties and to comply with the relevant conservation requirements. The remaining costs were incurred as part of the usual works done before the commencement of a tenancy to ensure that the property is habitable.
Second, the post makes the statement that trees at 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road were allowed to be felled because the properties were leased by Minister's Shanmugam and Balakrishnan.
This is untrue
. The identity of the tenants had no bearing on the felling of the trees at the properties. All decisions to fell trees with a girth size of more than one metre were made following inspections by independent arborists, and safety issues were identified. Where approval was required for any trees to be felled, such approval was obtained from the National Parks Board (NParks). The reasons for the felling of the trees at both properties have been explained by the Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong in Parliament on 3 July 2023.
Third, the post makes the statement that SPH Media Trust (SMT) fraudulently inflated its circulation numbers.
This is untrue
. The overstatement of circulation numbers happened when the media business was under SPH Limited ' a listed company. This was before SMT was incorporated. When SMT took over SPH Limited's media business, it discovered, reported, and investigated the circulation issue. The Government's funding agreement to build up public service media capabilities was signed with SMT, and not SPH Limited. The funding quantum was based on SMT's transformation needs, and not the circulation numbers.

This statement is
untrue
for the following reasons:
On 1 November 2021, the Leader of the House made a complaint against Ms Khan, who was then a Member of Parliament for Sengkang Group Representation Constituency, for breaches of privilege ('
the Complaint
') and the Complaint was referred to the Committee of Privileges ('
COP
'). This was followed by a memorandum dated 26 November 2021 from the Leader of the House setting out the particulars of the Complaint.
The Complaint was in relation to Ms Khan's conduct, for speaking various untruths in Parliament, and for failing to substantiate an allegation she made in Parliament on 3 August 2021.
The Complaint was not in respect of Mr Singh and did not refer to any aspect of Mr Singh's conduct.
Mr Singh did, however, appear as a witness before the COP and the COP, in its report presented to Parliament on 10 February 2022 (""
Report
""), found, amongst other things, that Mr Singh had wanted to 'suppress the fact that [he] had known about Ms Khan's Untruth in Parliament for 3 months' (Report at paragraph 198(1)).
The COP also found that Mr Singh had told untruths to the COP (Report at paragraph 231) and the COP accordingly recommended that Parliament refer Mr Singh's conduct in being untruthful to the COP to the Public Prosecutor (Report at paragraph 233).
On 15 February 2022, Parliament resolved to accept, amongst other things, the COP's recommendation to refer Mr Singh's conduct in being untruthful to the COP to the Public Prosecutor.
The remaining assertions made in the Facebook Post (which was reproduced in the TikTok post by user 'jansenng1') are based on the false premise that a Committee of Privileges was convened to look into Mr Pritam Singh's alleged non-disclosure of his knowledge of Ms Khan's lies.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ('PM') and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong ('DPM Wong') did not want to disclose the fact of Minister Iswaran's arrest on 11 July 2023 because it was politically embarrassing.
In his doorstop interview on 12 July 2023, DPM Wong deliberately withheld information that two arrests had been made in connection with the case because he wanted to conceal the truth.
These statements are false.
Facts
The facts are as follows:
On
12 July 2023
,
The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau ('CPIB') issued a press release that Minister Iswaran was assisting CPIB with the investigation into a case uncovered by CPIB. CPIB also acknowledged the interest by members of the public in this case because a Minister was being interviewed by CPIB.
PM separately issued a statement that the formal investigation began on 11 July 2023 and Minister Iswaran was assisting CPIB with the ongoing investigations.
DPM Wong said that CPIB needed to interview Minister Iswaran as part of further investigations. DPM stated 'We will be upfront and transparent, and we will not sweep anything under the carpet, even if they are potentially embarrassing or damaging to the PAP and to the government'. He also stated that he was unable to provide more information because the CPIB investigations were ongoing.
On
13 July 2023
, the Prime Minister's Office said that Minister lswaran would remain in Singapore during his leave of absence; and that he would have no access to any official resources and government buildings.
On
14 July 2023
, in response to media queries, CPIB stated that Minister Iswaran and Mr Ong Beng Seng were arrested on 11 July 2023, and subsequently released on bail.
Whether to arrest a person under investigation is an operational judgement by CPIB. In addition, whether and when to make public that a person has been arrested in connection with their investigations is a decision for the CPIB. In the usual course, it is the CPIB (and not Minister's) which releases such information.
CPIB's press release on 12 July 2023 stated that Minister Iswaran was assisting CPIB with the investigation into a case uncovered by CPIB. CPIB did not then state that Minister Iswaran had been arrested on 11 July 2023.
As it is CPIB's operational judgement when and whether to make public that a person has been arrested in connection with their investigations, PM's statement of 12 July 2023 and DPM Wong at his doorstop interview on the same day were consistent with CPIB's 12 July 2023 press release. It is therefore untrue that PM or DPM Wong did not want to disclose the fact of Minister Iswaran's arrest because it was politically embarrassing, or that DPM had deliberately withheld information on the arrests because he wanted to conceal the truth. It is also not a case of PM and DPM Wong abdicating their responsibility to disclose such information.  Instead, PM and DPM did not want to deviate from what CPIB had announced in its statement since this is related to operational matters.
Minister's have to let CPIB independently decide on the release of operational information. CPIB must be afforded the necessary time and space it needs to conduct a proper, thorough, and independent investigation.

The Ministry of Law would also like to provide additional clarifications on other misleading points raised in the Jom article.
False statements of fact
Correction Direction issued by the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law
First, the article makes the statement that Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean did not respond to questions concerning the issue of actual or apparent conflicts of interest and possible breach of the Code of Conduct for Minister's beyond replying that it is more important to observe the spirit rather than just the letter of the Code.
This is untrue.
The article omits important information from what Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said in Parliament on 3 July 2023.
Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean had expressly clarified that he meant it was important to observe the spirit as well as the letter of the Code. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also said that Minister Shanmugam had recused himself, and this meant that he no longer had any duty in the matter. There could thus be no potential or actual conflict of interest. He explained how Minister Shanmugam had removed himself from the chain of command and decision-making process entirely in the case of 26 Ridout Road. He had also highlighted that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had established, as part of its independent investigation, that no matter was raised by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to the Ministry of Law and hence to any of the Minister's during the entire rental process.
Second, the article makes the statement that SLA spent more than $1 million on the renovation for 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road because the Minister's were to be the tenants.
This is untrue
. The identity of the tenants had no bearing on the amount spent by SLA on the works it carried out on 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. The article implies that this sum was unusually large. The article omits important information that the works done by SLA were consistent with SLA's general practice, and were assessed to be necessary in the circumstances, as explained by Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong in Parliament on 3 July 2023.
SLA invests a significant amount in maintaining conserved properties such as 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. A key reason for the cost is the nature of the conservation requirements for such properties, which are much older than the average property in Singapore.  Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong had spoken at length in Parliament about the details of these conservation requirements. While the maintenance works are done in periodic cycles, SLA does them in the lead up to a confirmed tenancy where practical, to avoid disrupting existing tenants and to ensure that the costs can be recovered from the prospective tenant. SLA has published information showing that similar and even larger amounts have been spent by SLA on other Black and White bungalows (see
Annex A
) in a manner consistent with conservation requirements.
In the case of 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road, most of the costs incurred by SLA were for works that external consultants had determined to be necessary, in light of the condition of the properties and to comply with the relevant conservation requirements. The remaining costs were incurred as part of the usual works done before the commencement of a tenancy to ensure that the property is habitable.
The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and
Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction
1
to Jom in respect of its article.
Correction Direction issued by the Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs
The article also makes the statement that the Government caused Instagram to geo-block a post by Charles Yeo.
This is untrue.
The Government did not issue any directions or requests on this matter to Meta, Instagram's parent company, that caused Instagram to geo-block the post in question.
The Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction Direction to Jom in respect of its article.
Additional clarifications
In addition to the false statements of fact outlined above, the article states that Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean should have recused himself from the review as he was 'both the informed and investigating officer'. This is a flawed argument. As explained in Parliament, the facts of the case had been established by CPIB in an investigation which was independent, thorough and authoritative. There is no conflict of interest for Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean to conduct the review, as he was not an involved party in the rental process and no matters were raised to him regarding any aspect of the rental transaction. This is similar to a situation where a director declares a potential conflict of interest to a Chairman of an organisation; if it is subsequently alleged that the director had a conflict of interest, it does not preclude the Chairman from convening a disciplinary committee or even sitting on it, unless he was a participant in the actions of that director which resulted in the conflict of interest.
Next, the article implies that SLA charged just over 10 cents per square foot of land for 26 Ridout Road, and was wrong in doing so.

The article conveys a false picture, by omitting key facts: that the market practice is for the rental valuation of such residential properties to be based primarily on the Gross Floor Area (GFA) of the  property, and that the valuation of the rental in respect of 26 Ridout Road followed established market practice. 26 Ridout Road was rented at market value, and the rental was comparable with the rental of other Black and White bungalows in the Ridout Road Estate in 2018 and 2019.
Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong explained that the rent is assessed by professional valuers from SLA's independent valuation team or valuers appointed by SLA's managing agents, taking into account market-driven considerations, as well as other relevant factors such as the location and condition of the property. He also explained that the valuer for 26 Ridout Road did not know that Minister Shanmugam was the potential tenant. The valuer performed the valuation using established principles and methods. The article also omits to mention that Minister Shanmugam did not want the additional land, but it was in SLA's interests to add that land to the tenancy to make the tenant responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the land.
The article also insinuates that the Government will hinder deeper conversation about why there is a need to conserve so many Black and White bungalows and the land around them, because Minister's Shanmugam and Balakrishnan are staying in two of the largest of such properties.
The Government does not hinder conversation on conservation and land use matters, and the identity of tenants is not a relevant consideration. The reasons for conserving certain Black and White bungalows were in fact addressed in Parliament on 3 July 2023, where Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong spoke about the heritage and historical value of these properties. It was explained that the use of such properties takes into account master-planning considerations for the area and the specific circumstances of each set of properties such as the heritage value, location, and allowable uses. In some cases, Black and White bungalows may be demolished as a cluster to make way for newer developments.
Conclusion
The Ministerial Statements by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong provided a comprehensive account of the facts and background context of the rentals of 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road. Parliament spent about six hours on a reasoned and thorough discussion of the issue, covering matters related to the independent investigation and review by the CPIB and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean respectively, and also matters raised in the public domain.

This is untrue

On 3 July 2023, the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong stated in Parliament that neither Livspace nor Minister Shanmugam's son was appointed by SLA to carry out works for 26 Ridout Road or 31 Ridout Road.
As with its approach for other State properties, SLA had engaged an external consultant to assess the works needed to be carried out. Thereafter, contracts to carry out the works were awarded to separate contractors through open tenders.
SLA did not award any contract to Livspace to carry out works to 26 Ridout Road or 31 Ridout Road. As stated by the Second Minister for Law, SLA has not had any transactions with Livspace for these or other properties.

Falsehoods
Asia Sentinel's article falsely conveys that:
Following the publication of Andy Wong's ('Wong's') article 'The institutional failures behind Singapore's latest COVID outbreak' on
Nikkei Asia
on 23 July 2021 ('
Nikkei Asia
Article'), the Singapore Government threatened to end Nikkei Inc.'s business operations in Singapore;
M Ravi was suspended from practising law for five years because he had criticised the Government; and
Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern were forced to leave Singapore because government action was threatened against them for warring with Lee Hsien Loong.
Facts
The
Nikkei Asia
Article contained many factual inaccuracies. A senior official from the Ministry of Home Affairs responded to the
Nikkei Asia
Article
on 28 July 2021, giving the facts. At no point did the Singapore Government threaten to end Nikkei Inc.'s operations in Singapore.
M Ravi was suspended from practising law for five years not because he had criticised the Government. He was suspended because the Court of Three Judges found that his various allegations against the Attorney-General, Deputy Attorney-General and prosecutors, and the Law Society, had recklessly and baselessly undermined the pillars of Singapore's legal system, and would cause grave injury to public confidence in the legal profession and the administration of justice in Singapore. For instance, M Ravi had accused the Prosecution of being '
overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence [in Gobi's case]
'. M Ravi had also threatened to commence proceedings against the Law Society '
if it entertains any further complaints or partcipates [sic] in any harassment by AG to harass me in doing my job
.'
Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern were not forced to leave Singapore under threat of Government action for warring with Lee Hsien Loong. They left Singapore after the Police engaged them for an investigation. The Police had commenced investigations into Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern for possible offences of giving false evidence in judicial proceedings, following findings by the Court of Three Judges and a Disciplinary Tribunal investigating charges of professional misconduct against Lee Suet Fern, that Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern had lied under oath. This police investigation has nothing to do with 'warring with Lee Hsien Loong'.
The false statements could erode public trust in the Singapore Government and the Judiciary.

 These publications contain the following false statements:  
Tangaraju had requested an interpreter during the recording of his statement but was denied one.
Tangaraju neither had an interpreter nor access to legal counsel during his trial.
It was never pointed out to Tangaraju that Steven Chong JCA was the Attorney-General when decisions were taken by the Attorney-General's Chambers in respect of Tangaraju's case. The courts did not ascertain whether Tangaraju had any objection to Steven Chong JCA hearing matters relating to Tangaraju's case.
Tangaraju was convicted, and sentenced to hang, and later found to be not guilty.
Several personal costs orders were made against M Ravi without justifiable basis, to penalise him for his work in death penalty cases.
Facts
Tangaraju, a 46-year old Singaporean, was convicted of abetting the trafficking of 1017.9 grammes of cannabis. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of cannabis is more than 500 grammes. 1017.9 grammes is more than twice the capital threshold, and sufficient to feed the addiction of about 150 abusers for a week.
Tangaraju's allegation that he requested for but was denied an interpreter during the recording of his statement is false, and was rejected by the High Court. The High Court found this bare allegation, raised for the first time during Tangaraju's cross-examination, to be disingenuous given Tangaraju's admission that he had made no such request for any of the other statements subsequently recorded from him.
Tangaraju was accorded full due process under the law. He was represented by legal counsel and had access to an interpreter throughout his trial.
Tangaraju's then counsel was informed, before the appeal was heard, that Steven Chong JCA was the Attorney-General when decisions were taken in respect of the case. Steven Chong JCA was not, however, involved in the decision-making process, and Tangaraju's then counsel was informed of this as well. Tangaraju's then counsel replied to confirm that Tangaraju had no objections to Steven Chong JCA being a member of the coram for the Court of Appeal, to hear his appeal.
Tangaraju's conviction by the High Court was upheld by the Court of Appeal, which is the apex court in Singapore. His conviction has not been overturned.
Costs orders were made against M Ravi for justifiable reasons and in accordance with the law, as can be found in the court judgments, which are publicly available. Some of these costs orders were made in respect of M Ravi filing unmeritorious applications to the courts, which were found to be abuses of the court process.
The false statements could erode public trust in the Singapore Government and the Judiciary.

The Online Citizen Asia's ('TOCA') article published on its website on 2 May 2023 ('TOCA Article'); and
TOCA's social media posts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn) on 2 May 2023 which reference the TOCA Article ('TOCA's Social Media Posts').
These publications contain false statements relating to the Incident.
Facts
On 17 May 2021 at 6.43pm, the Police received a call for assistance from a member of the public, reporting that an elderly woman, who was not wearing a mask, looked lost. The Police officers who responded to the incident were concerned that the elderly woman had lost her way and their primary aim was to render assistance to her and help her find her way home. This is very clear from the footages captured by the officers' body worn cameras.
In view of the COVID-19 situation at that time, and the prevailing requirements to wear a mask in public places, the Police officers had reminded the elderly woman to wear her mask. Their primary concern, however, was to help her find her way home.
The Police did not make any misrepresentations to the family members of the elderly woman; she was indeed lost. While the elderly woman's daughter-in-law had lodged a Police report, this was because: (a) The Online Citizen ('TOC') (now defunct) had released an article spreading falsehoods about the interactions of the Police officers with the elderly woman; and (b) TOC had interviewed her mother-in-law (i.e. the elderly woman) without her permission, and she was afraid that TOC would follow her mother-in-law home or attempt to interview her mother-in-law again.
Prior statements by the Police and the Minister for Home Affairs had accurately presented the facts in relation to the Incident.
The Police did not withhold any evidence that would disprove their narrative or provide false evidence to the Court. All footage from the body worn cameras of the Police officers at the scene which captured their interactions with the elderly woman were submitted to the Court.
The High Court dismissed TOC's appeal against the POFMA Correction Direction issued in relation to the Incident. It found that the Police officers who had approached the elderly woman believed that she had lost her way.
The allegations made by Xu and TOCA that the authorities had misrepresented the facts could lead to erosion of public trust in the Singapore Police Force.
The Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions

2022-11-18,Corrections and clarifications regarding the Government's fiscal surpluses and Singapore's Reserves,False and misleading statements in Facebook posts and articles published by Yeoh Lam Keong and The Independent Singapore,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually181122/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/bd34e90e-0e58-46bf-a56f-ac58347cd96c/singapore-financial-buildings.jpg,"On 7 November 2022, Mr Yeoh Lam Keong ('
Yeoh
') published two Facebook posts stating that '... we have a $30 bn structural fiscal surplus that we have not even begun to publicly delineate clear spending big plans for.' The Independent Singapore ('
TISG
') reproduced Yeoh's statement in two of its articles dated 9 November 2022 and 12 November 2022 respectively.
Yeoh's statement claims that there are $30 billion in structural fiscal surpluses that are available to the Government for spending.
This is untrue
.
Over the last two decades (excluding FY2020, which had a significant fiscal deficit due to COVID-19 expenditures), the Government recorded on average a fiscal balance of $2.2 billion per annum. It is therefore untrue that the Government has 'a $30 bn structural fiscal surplus' that is available for spending yearly.
The Constitution defines clearly the fiscal rules for the Government. Any public spending beyond these fiscal rules means that we will be using more from the Past Reserves, and leaving behind less for the next generation.
Furthermore, the Government is not in a position to freely or unilaterally decide to spend any part of the Past Reserves. Any drawing of the Past Reserves is subject to the President's concurrence.
The Minister for Finance has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue Correction Directions to Yeoh and TISG. The Correction Directions require the recipients to insert, amongst others, a notice against the original posts / articles, with a link to the Government's clarification.
Additional Clarifications
In his Facebook posts, Yeoh also expressed his view that 'our reserves' would grow very strongly (
i.e,
at 'the rate of $50-$100 bn a year') for the next 5 to 10 years because of balance of payment ('
BOP
') surpluses, leading to higher Net Investment Returns Contribution ('
NIRC
') derived from the reserves, over the medium to longer term. This view was also reproduced by TISG in its article on 9 November 2022.
The Constitution defines the 'Reserves' as the total assets less total liabilities (i.e. net assets) of the Government and other entities specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('
MAS
').
1
 The assets include the Official Foreign Reserves ('
OFR
') held by MAS.
It is misleading to suggest that BOP surpluses will lead to our Reserves growing very strongly for the next 5 to 10 years.
First, while BOP surpluses correspond to an increase in OFR assets,
this increase in OFR assets does not result in an equivalent increase in the Reserves
. This is because the increase in OFR assets may be matched by increases in MAS' liabilities. For instance, when MAS purchases foreign assets whilst implementing monetary policy, the increase in OFR is accompanied by an increase in MAS' liabilities, such as MAS Bills.
Second, it is
speculative to suggest that MAS' OFR will continue to grow at the same rate as historical BOP trends
. While MAS has had a steady accumulation of OFR in recent years, this took place during a period of unprecedented monetary easing globally. The same monetary conditions are now turning with global central banks tightening monetary policy aggressively. Trends in OFR accumulation will change against this evolving global monetary backdrop.
Yeoh thinks that strong 'reserves' growth and 'higher NIRC revenues' will give us a 'fair chance' of addressing our spending needs. But this is misguided.
The returns from the investment of our Reserves are more likely to slow over time, given the structural challenges in the world, including rising geopolitical tensions, climate change, and ageing populations.
In the past 5 years, the NIRC provided an average annual revenue stream of about 3.5% of GDP. MOF has already explained that we expect the NIRC to keep pace broadly with economic growth over the medium to longer term.
2
 That means that as government spending continues to increase as a share of GDP, we will need to rely on other revenue sources to close the funding gap.

Both posts state that the reply was 'a rather disingenuous and misleading analysis of the supposed $270 mln loss made by HDB' and alleged that 'the accounting sleight of hand being the omission that the Government acquired most of the land at minimal or much lower cost by compulsory acquisition'. Both posts continued, 'the advertised loss is thus only the opportunity cost of the state reselling the land at market price which it has psssed (sic) on to HDB, hence the 'loss'. The true cost price should be the original book value of the land plus construction costs which on average is much lower than BTO prices before subsidy.' The Online Citizen (TOC) subsequently carried an article on the same day echoing the points raised in Yeoh's Facebook posts.
Yeoh's Facebook posts falsely convey the following:
HDB will not incur a loss of about $270 million from the Central Weave @ AMK Build-To-Order (BTO) Project; and
The Government is free to sell State land at nominal or much lower cost than its fair market value.
On 5 Oct 2022, TOC published a second article headlined 'Singapore's reserves substantially profits from $500m land sales in AMK BTO'. The article claimed that Minister (ND)'s reply alluded to 'profits being made from the land sale by the government' and that 'such profits would go to the reserves'. The headline falsely conveys that the Government's sale of land to HDB for the Central Weave @ AMK BTO project will lead to an increase in Singapore's reserves.
Facts
The losses incurred by HDB, as stated by Minister (ND) in Parliament, are accurate and real.
For the Central Weave @ AMK project, HDB will incur an estimated development loss of about $250 million, or about $270 million after taking into account housing grants.
HDB's deficits are covered using funding from the annual Budget, which is raised from taxes and other revenue streams.
Real money is involved, and this is certainly not an 'accounting sleight of hand'.
State Land is part of the Past Reserves. It is not part of the assets that the Government can use as it wishes. When HDB requires land to develop flats, the land has to be taken out of the Past Reserves. HDB has to purchase the land by paying fair market value for the land, and the money goes into the Past Reserves. The estimated land cost for Central Weave @ AMK is about $500 million.
The Government cannot sell State land at nominal or much lower cost than its fair market value without the President's approval, as doing so would constitute a draw on Past Reserves.
Past Reserves are protected by the Constitution for the benefit of current and future generations. The President's concurrence is needed before the Government can draw on Past Reserves.
Past Reserves are invested, and the Government can use part of the investment income to meet Singapore's needs. This income is currently our biggest single source of revenue, exceeding the revenue from personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, or GST. Past Reserves are also an emergency fund for use during crises, for example in managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
If the Government arbitrarily prices the land below its fair market value, such as at the historical price that past Government's had paid to acquire the land, or at just a nominal $1, then it is not putting back fully what it has taken out from Past Reserves. This is equivalent to drawing down the Reserves and short-changing future generations, depriving them of their nest-egg.
To consume Past Reserves at the expense of Singapore's future generations and security is populist and irresponsible. Our Constitution is designed to try to stop any Government from this kind of behaviour.
There is an established process to determine the fair market value of land.
The Chief Valuer, a public officer whose appointment requires the President's concurrence, determines independently the fair market value using well-accepted and established valuation principles.
These are the same valuation principles adopted by professional valuers in the private sector.
The current fair market value of land is not the same as the historical cost incurred to acquire the land, as the market value of land is influenced by factors such as the current planned land use.
Neither the Government nor the Past Reserves profit from land sales. When State land is disposed of at fair market value, there is no addition to the Past Reserves but a conversion of one type of asset (land) to another (cash). For the Central Weave @ AMK BTO project, HDB will pay the Government fair market value for the land, estimated to be about $500 million. This money will be paid into the Past Reserves, but does not result in a net increase in the Past Reserves.
The Minister for National Development has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue Correction Directions to Yeoh Lam Keong and The Online Citizen. The Correction Directions require recipients to insert, amongst others, a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.
Delivering good, affordable homes for Singaporeans
HDB does not price new flats to recover the cost of land and construction. Instead, it prices flats significantly below market value using generous subsidies to ensure that they are affordable to Singaporeans.
We can see this from resale transactions, where many flat-owners sell their flats on the open market at prices higher than those of comparable BTO flats.
HDB also provides housing grants to help specific groups of buyers with their first flat purchase.
With generous subsidies and housing grants, most first-timer households use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their HDB loans.
HDB will continue to use its allocated resources judiciously to provide good, affordable homes for Singaporeans.",1.3171015,8.122123,2022,4,Housing (Read: HDB Prices),The Online Citizen; Yeoh Lam Keong

2022-09-04,Corrections regarding HDB's BTO programme,Falsehood in Facebook post by The Alternative View that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK Build-To-Order flats,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually040922/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/0cad5f38-221f-4097-8438-b5c0fd2b9fc9/neighbourhood-render-banner.jpg,"On 1 September 2022, The Alternative View published a Facebook post, which reproduces the headline of an article from AsiaOne (dated 31 August 2022) stating 'Ang Mo Kio BTO flats: Strong demand for 5-room units despite prices of up to $877k', contains an image of the Minister for National Development holding a bag of money, and ends with the caption asking 'How much profit is HDB reaping from this?'. Implicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which are part of the August 2022 BTO sales exercise. This statement is false.
Facts
HDB will not profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK BTO flats. In fact, it will incur a loss from this project.
The estimated amount to be collected from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK BTO flats is lower than the estimated total development cost of the project (comprising land cost and construction cost). If we take into account the CPF housing grants that HDB will extend to eligible buyers, the deficit is higher still.
This is consistent with the fact that the amount HDB collects from the sale of flats in every financial year is
less
than the cost it incurs, including the total development cost (comprising land cost and construction cost) and CPF housing grants. HDB incurs a deficit every year.
For the Financial Year (FY) 2021/22, HDB recorded a deficit of $3.85 billion in its Homeownership Programme. The average deficit incurred by HDB in the last three years (FY2019/20 ' FY2021/22) was about $2.68 billion a year.
The annual deficit, funded by Government grants, is reflected in HDB's audited financial statements published annually.

The Correction Direction requires recipients to insert, amongst others, a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government's clarification.
Delivering affordable and quality homes for Singaporeans
HDB's deficit is largely due to the significant subsidies extended for new flats and the disbursement of CPF housing grants for eligible buyers. Because of this, most first-timer buyers use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their housing loans. Close to 90% of first-timer families service their HDB loans using CPF with little or no cash payments.

Goh's post gave the impression that 'A' and her partner have not received any assistance from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and other agencies. This is false.
Facts
'A' is known to MSF as Mdm A.
Mdm A has been receiving ComCare assistance from MSF since June 2015 without any pause in monthly assistance. Mdm A's last ComCare assistance period was from December 2021 to April 2022, before the current renewal from May 2022 to August 2022. Also, her monthly assistance sum was increased from May 2022 onwards.
Her partner has been receiving ComCare assistance for various periods since June 2015. His last assistance period was from October 2021 to March 2022. It was renewed from April to September 2022.
Besides MSF, Mdm A and her partner also receive financial and non-financial help from other agencies and community partners, including the Agency for Integrated Care, MUIS (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore), Tan Tock Seng Hospital, THK Family Service Centre @ MacPherson and Home Nursing Foundation. Together, Mdm A and her partner are currently receiving more than $2,000 in financial assistance from MSF and other agencies each month. This includes cash, rental assistance, assistance for service and conservancy charges, utility assistance and Public Healthcare Assistance.
Mdm A had not reached out to MSF for additional help before the Facebook post was published.
The false statement in Goh's post gives the impression that MSF and other agencies are not aware of, or are not doing anything about, Mdm A's situation. This is not the case, and it is important to set the facts straight. Such false statements erode public trust and lead to misunderstanding about the support and assistance provided to families in need by MSF and other agencies.
MSF and other agencies are continuing to do our utmost to support and assist families who are in need. If members of the public come across individuals and families who require financial or social support, they may call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 or approach the nearest

The article had the headline '
K Shanmugam says he may step down as Singapore's Minister of Law and Home Affairs
'. The headline was clickbait, giving the false impression that the Minister for Law and Home Affairs said he may be stepping down from his ministerial positions.
The first paragraph of the article further stated that the Minister had '
revealed
' in a video interview with Vanakkam Malaysia that '
he may step down as a minister, but gave no specific time as to when he might do so
'. This again gave the false impression that the Minister said he may be stepping down from his ministerial positions.
Facts
The Minister did not say during the video interview with Vanakkam Malaysia that he may be stepping down from his ministerial positions or that he is contemplating doing so.
Instead, in reply to the interviewer's question, 'Have you ever felt politics is not allowing you to be true to yourself and regretted about it?', the Minister had reaffirmed his willingness and desire to serve Singapore.
In his response, the Minister stated:
''¦ I consider serving people as a privilege. Not everyone will get the chance. '¦ I am here as a minister because of people's support and love. The moment when there is no support, I must be ready to leave. '¦ When there are capable leaders to replace me then I should be ready to move on too. Only then will the country progress. '¦ I have maintained transparency in both my words and actions. I clearly tell the public what are the challenges and what do we need to do to overcome them. I will continue to do that. The moment when I feel I can't keep to that anymore, I will leave my ministerial posts.'
It is quite false to state that the Minister had said that he may be stepping down from his Ministerial posts. In addition, viewing the whole video will show that the Minister, when he spoke about his own views, also intended his comments to be of general application, for persons holding Ministerial appointments (when seen in the context of past comments of the PAP leadership, and history of the PAP).

The Committee found that Mr Singh (and to a lesser extent, Mr Faisal and Ms Lim) were untruthful in their evidence, under oath, to the Committee.
The Committee found that Mr Singh lied to the Committee on the key points, as to what had happened, and tried to conceal his involvement in Ms Khan's Untruth.
The Committee found that Mr Singh lied in order to put the entire blame on Ms Khan ' when, in fact, she had, from 8 August 2021, followed his advice and guidance. He said two other witnesses, Ms Loh Pei Ying ('
Ms Loh
') and Mr Yudhishthra Nathan ('
Mr Nathan
') (Workers' Party cadre members), lied. He said this, in an attempt to save himself, and avoid responsibility for his own conduct. The Committee found that Ms Loh and Mr Nathan were honest and credible witnesses, who spoke the truth.
The Committee found that contrary to his evidence, Mr Singh was the operating brain, the primary cause for: (1) why Ms Khan did not clarify the Untruth immediately after 8 August 2021, and (2) why Ms Khan repeated the Untruth in Parliament on 4 October 2021. This was consequent on its findings that:
On 8 August 2021, when Ms Khan confessed the Untruth to Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal, Mr Singh told Ms Khan to 'take it to the grave', i.e. take the Untruth to the grave. (The Committee also found that Ms Lim and Mr Faisal lied to the Committee about the 8 August 2021 meeting.)
On 3 October 2021, Mr Singh guided Ms Khan to maintain the Untruth in Parliament, if the matter came up the next day. He told Ms Khan that if she were to retain or continue with the narrative (the Untruth), 'there would be no judgment' on her.
After Ms Khan confessed in Parliament, and when there was adverse public reaction, Mr Singh, as the Secretary-General of Workers' Party (and Ms Lim and Mr Faisal) engineered a Disciplinary Panel (comprised only of themselves). He advised Ms Khan to lie, then held the Disciplinary Inquiry to ostensibly find out why she had lied. The Disciplinary Inquiry suppressed the fact that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had known and been involved in Ms Khan's Untruth, for 3 months, and covered up Mr Singh's role, in guiding Ms Khan to continue with the Untruth on 4 October 2021.
Parliament has the power to impose penalties on Mr Singh, based on the Committee's findings that he lied on oath (which is an offence under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act 1962).
The Committee however has recommended referring Mr Singh's conduct to the Public Prosecutor, so that Mr Singh will have the opportunity to defend and vindicate himself, with legal counsel, if criminal charges are brought, and so that a court can look at the matter afresh, and consider any further evidence that may emerge, and decide whether any charge(s) have been proved, or not proved, beyond reasonable doubt.
The Committee also found that Mr Faisal deliberately refused to answer a question put by the Committee. He refused eight times, even though he was told that such refusal to answer may be an offence. He has been referred to the Public Prosecutor for his conduct, in refusing to answer.

2022-02-07,Inaccurate Statements About the Labour Market,The number of unemployed Singapore citizens decreased from March to June 2021; foreigners are not the majority holding PMET jobs.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/inaccurate-statements-about-the-labour-market/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/e3f89626-caf3-4773-92c5-a77427a7ff74/Factually-Article-7-Feb-lowres.jpeg,"In a Facebook post published by Mr Leong Sze Hian on 26 December 2021, he claimed that:
The number of unemployed Singapore citizens grew from March 2021 to June 2021; and
The majority of professional, managerial, executive and technical (PMET) jobs were held by foreigners.
Mr Leong's claims are inaccurate. Here are the facts based on the data:
Did the number of unemployed Singapore citizens increase from March 2021 to June 2021?
When analysing unemployment trends across quarters, one should look at the seasonally adjusted numbers. Over the course of the year, unemployment levels may fluctuate due to seasonal events. This includes major holidays when where retail and F&B outlets typically increase hiring and school breaks when more students may temporarily enter the job market.
In its regular releases, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) reports the seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and number of unemployed citizens. From March 2021 to June 2021,
the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed citizens decreased by 10,400. It then held steady from June to September 2021.
Using the non-seasonally adjusted number of unemployed citizens will lead to the wrong conclusion. June coincides with the period when students look for vacation jobs, and fresh graduates enter the labour market. Hence, the number of job seekers will be expectedly higher compared to other months. Seasonal adjustment removes this effect, and the seasonally adjusted numbers show that unemployment in fact trended down from March to June 2021, as reflected in the table below.

Are the majority of PMET jobs held by foreigners?
Foreigners account for 22% of all PMET jobs in 2020
1
.  They are not the majority holding PMET jobs.
 From 2010 to 2020, the number of local PMETs increased by about 300,000, while the number of Employment Pass and S Pass holders increased by 110,000. This means that
not only are there more locals in PMET jobs, the increase in local PMETs significantly outnumbered the increase in foreign PMETs by around 3:1.
Competition between locals and foreigners is not a zero-sum game. In fact, the converse is true. By complementing the local workforce with a diverse foreign workforce, Singapore can attract more investments, grow the economy, and create more good jobs for Singaporeans.

2021-12-03,Corrections and Clarifications on falsehoods regarding content about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant in Facebook posts by Goh Meng Seng,Misleading information about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually031221/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/2d9246f1-5239-4ad0-b316-8d1f84cc27b1/Omicron_factually.jpeg,"A video posted by Goh Meng Seng on 27 November 2021 on various online locations on Facebook contained false and egregious claims about the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, there is currently no basis to conclude that:
     (i) The COVID-19 and HIV viruses could combine and become another air-borne virus; and
     (ii) Omicron is vaccine-resistant, and vaccines are totally useless against it.
Here are the facts.
Fact #1: The COVID-19 and HIV viruses cannot combine and become another virus which has the characteristics of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses.
Genetic recombination (that is, the exchange of genetic information) of viruses is known to occur only in genetically related viruses. The HIV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are not related, and it is implausible in biological terms that these viruses can undergo genetic recombination. To date, there is also no scientific evidence that such a recombination between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, contrary to Goh's assertion.
Fact #2: The COVID-19 and HIV viruses cannot combine in a fully vaccinated patient to become an airborne HIV virus which is vaccine resistant.
The claim that HIV might become transmissible by droplets in the air is also unfounded. Viruses simply do not change drastically enough to take on vastly different properties.  HIV is transmitted via bodily fluids, e.g., blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, and will remain to be so.
Fact #3: The Omicron variant is not a combination of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses.
There is simply no scientific evidence to make that claim.
Fact #4: There is no evidence to suggest that the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are totally useless against the Omicron variant.
Studies are ongoing, and there is currently insufficient data on how the Omicron variant affects vaccine effectiveness. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will retain some effectiveness against the Omicron variant, but protection may be less due to the large number of mutations in the Omicron variant.

It is important to correct these falsehoods, especially given the on-going vaccine booster exercise.
In particular, the blog post misleads people into thinking that the COVID vaccines are the most dangerous developed recently as they have caused a substantially higher rate of death and serious injury compared to all other vaccines over the last 10 years.
Here are the facts.
Fact #1: COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Singapore are safe. The serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare professionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered.
COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Singapore are safe. They have been assessed to be safe and effective internationally by reputable health and scientific agencies, and in Singapore by both the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V). As of 31 October 2021, the serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare professionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered. Thus far, no deaths have been attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of receiving COVID-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh the risks of vaccination.
Fact #2: The United States' Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
1
data do not support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a substantially higher rate of serious injury and death.
First, COVID-19 vaccines have been given to a very large proportion of the US population in 2021, while the other vaccines have been given to substantially fewer individuals in any given year. Thus, it is misleading to compare the absolute number of reported adverse events and deaths for COVID-19 and non-COVID vaccines.
Second, there is much higher surveillance and awareness of adverse event reporting for COVID-19 vaccines, compared with other vaccines.
Third,  any member of the public may report adverse events and deaths to the VAERS system, regardless whether it is caused by vaccines or other factors. The reports are not required to be verified. They often lack details and sometimes contain errors. No proof is required that the adverse event or death was caused by the vaccine. And adverse events need not be serious; they include mild side effects such as rash/cold/headaches.
The post has been written to falsely exaggerate the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines, and to discourage people from taking them. If people believe these falsehoods, there could be serious health consequences for those who then remain unvaccinated. As stated earlier, the evidence so far is that serious adverse events have been reported in only 0.006% of total doses administered.

2021-10-24,"Corrections and Clarifications regarding content about COVID-19 by ""Truth Warriors"" website","Misleading information about ivermectin, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination injuries",Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually241021/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/240af963-0cdd-4ba6-b542-b24c42e40195/vials-red.jpg,"Many of the materials published in the 'Truth Warriors' website mislead people into thinking that COVID-19 vaccines are not effective in reducing transmission rates of COVID-19, and promote the safety and efficacy of ivermectin in preventing viral infections and treating COVID-19. These materials are from unverified and dubious sources, and individuals who heed the advice of 'Truth Warriors' can endanger themselves and the people around them.
In particular, the website has published false claims stating that:
(i) The most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per million population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest cases and deaths per million population; and
(ii) Vaccines do not prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
Here are the facts.
Fact #1: Vaccination does not increase COVID-19 infection and mortality rates
The weight of international evidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce COVID-19 infection, as well as serious illness and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. The latest data does not support the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the highest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest vaccination rates also have low reported COVID-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor record collection for both vaccinations and deaths.
Fact #2: Vaccines reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19
While the vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do reduce the risk of transmission. Vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus than unvaccinated persons. Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the virus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does not lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies and immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it.
Additional Clarifications
The website also claimed that ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection, and that it is safe and effective in treating COVID-19, even for pregnant women.
MOH and HSA are aware that there are members of the public trying to import or use ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections. It is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA for preventing or treating COVID-19. To date, there is no conclusive scientific evidence from rigorously conducted large-scale randomised controlled trials to prove that ivermectin is effective against COVID-19. There is also insufficient evidence to establish the safety profile of ivermectin during pregnancy, and, currently, women are advised not to take ivermectin if pregnant.
Self-medicating with ivermectin can be dangerous to your health. Side-effects associated with ivermectin include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners. There have been reports of patients requiring hospitalisation after self-medication with ivermectin. Consumers are strongly advised not to self-medicate with ivermectin and to consult their doctor for proper treatment of COVID-19. Only vaccines and treatments authorised by HSA have met the required safety, efficacy, and quality standards.
HSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply of medicines, including ivermectin, and will take strong enforcement action against such persons. Anyone convicted of the illegal sale of these medicines faces a penalty fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for a period of up to two years under the Health Products Act.
The website also shares user-collated and unverified data on suspected vaccine injuries in Singapore, citing the 'SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries' Telegram chat as its source.

A Facebook and an Instagram post containing a video showing a large group of travellers from South Asia arriving at Changi Airport Terminal 1 has been circulating. The video, published on the Singapore Incidents' Facebook and Instagram posts on 5 May 2021, contained a watermark indicating the date of the video as 5 May 2021 and the location as Changi Airport. There are also other similar videos spreading on social media.
This video, viewed in the light of the Government's public statements on the restrictions on entry by non-Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents with recent travel history to India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, implied that the Government's current restrictions on entry were not in effect, or that the travel ban was not being properly enforced, or enforced at all, by the Government.
The information in the video is false. The video was not filmed on 5 May 2021.
Clarifications
The video showed travellers from South Asia arriving at Changi Airport Terminal 1, and a clock indicating the time as 14:53 hrs. According to flight records, there were no flights from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) that arrived at any terminal in Changi Airport between 08:00 hrs and 15:30 hrs on 5 May 2021.
In the video, passengers were seen walking past a renovation hoarding at gate hold room D42/43 in Terminal 1. This hoarding had been removed on 5 April 2021, establishing that the video was taken before 5 April 2021.
As the Government announced previously, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India are not allowed entry into or transit through Singapore with effect from 23 April 2021, 23:59 hrs. This border control measure was extended to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka with effect from 1 May 2021, 23:59 hrs.
While there are still passenger flights arriving in Singapore from South Asia, these flights carry primarily returning Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents, cargo, or fly in empty to pick up passengers in Singapore who are returning to South Asia. For example, on 5 May 2021, there were 5 passenger flights arriving in Singapore from South Asia, carrying a total of 50 passengers, all of whom were returning Singapore citizens or Permanent Residents. The breakdown of passengers on these flights is as follows:

As of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.
The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor's current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.
The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the 3 main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).
COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the Ministry of Health and HSA.
Additional Clarifications
The Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund. If you require assistance with your medical bill, please contact the social worker at your healthcare institution.

2021-04-04,Clarifications on the Government's cash receipt and revenue,It is wrong to claim that the Government has more revenues than reported in the Budget Statement. This is why.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/clarifications-on-the-governments-cash-receipt-and-revenue/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/9a095f07-fecb-4902-87c5-e36565d7549f/singapore-city-MOF.jpg,"[Article is accurate as of 17 Feb 2023]
There have been materials circulated online that misunderstood the difference between the Government's cash receipts and revenue, leading to incorrect conclusions about our fiscal position and the need to raise GST.
For example, a March 2020 social media post queried the need to raise GST, alleging that the Government had more money at its disposal than what it had said, based on data from the Department of Statistics (DOS).
Distinction between cash receipts and revenue available for spending
The cited cash surpluses were taken from DOS, but wrong conclusions were made on budget deficits, surpluses, and the Government's overall fiscal position. Under our budgeting rules, there is a distinction between (a) cash receipts and (b) revenue that is available for spending.
Cash receipts reflect all the cash that comes in, but not all the cash that comes in constitutes revenue for expenditure.
Our budgeting rules reflect policy choices that the Government has made to safeguard the long-term interests of our citizens and future generations. These rules are enshrined in Singapore's Constitution, to require each term of Government to accumulate sufficient revenue to fund its expenditure.
Cash receipts
[1]
that are not considered revenue available for direct Government spending are instead channelled to our Past Reserves and invested. It is misleading to point to such cash receipts to claim that the Government has more revenue than it presents in the Budget Statement.
Monies from the sale of state land are not part of revenue available for Government spending
The largest of such cash receipts is the monies from the sale of state land. Land is a scarce and finite asset in Singapore and forms part of our reserves. Selling land does not increase revenue. Instead, land sales convert physical assets into financial assets. The Government then invests these financial assets to generate a sustainable stream of investment returns over the long term
[2]
, or use it for other land-related expenditure.
For example, if a family sells a house and uses the proceeds for day-to-day expenditure, it will soon have nothing left. However, if the family invests the proceeds of the sale wisely, it will still have the original sale proceeds, plus a constant stream of income from those proceeds. This income can then be used partially for expenditure and partially reinvested to help sustain both present and future members of the family.
We take the same sustainable approach to land sales. Land sales proceeds are not part of our revenue that can be directly used for expenditure. Instead they are invested, and we use part of the investment returns to support the spending needs of Singaporeans.
Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC)
In fact, the contributions from investment returns (known as the Net Investment Returns Contribution) are one of the largest sources of Government revenue.
This big contribution from investment returns supports about one-fifth of our spending needs. This is only possible because we have been disciplined in building and protecting both our land and financial reserves.
A sustainable and forward-looking budgeting system
Tapping on monies from land sales directly for spending today will change Singapore's sound orientation of saving and building for the future, to one of living for today and wishing that tomorrow would look after itself.
Relying directly on land sales for revenue for immediate spending is also not sound fiscal policy. The property market goes through up and down cycles, and is not a stable or predictable source of income in particular years. We must also avoid selling land purely for the Government's spending needs, rather than the long-term development plans that will benefit generations of Singaporeans.
The total cash receipts published by DOS include such land sales receipts, and do not represent what is available for the Government to spend under our budgeting rules
[3]
.
DOS's data are published in line with the IMF's guidelines, which are designed to provide a standardised way to report on the cash position of different countries of different sizes, systems of government, and levels of development. Such guidelines do not capture different budgeting rules and policy choices that countries and societies make for their own contexts. Using IMF's guidelines to calculate the resources available for spending is inaccurate, as these do not accurately reflect Singapore's fiscal position as defined by our own policy choices and context.
Singapore has put in place a set of budgeting rules that reflect our values of prudence and stewardship. Our way of budgeting is guided by the aim to build a sustainable and forward-looking system that benefits Singaporeans, both present and future generations, for many years to come.
How we present our Budget Statement reflects these values and aspirations.
[1]
For clarity, references to cash receipts hereafter refer to cash receipts as used by DOS in the computation of the cash surplus.
[2]
Monies from land sales form part of our Past Reserves. The investment returns of our reserves supplement the annual Budget through the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). Up to 50% of the Net Investment Returns on the net assets invested by GIC, MAS and Temasek, and up to 50% of the Net Investment Income derived from Past Reserves from the remaining assets is reflected in the Budget Statement as NIRC.
[3]
There are key differences between the Government 'Cash Surplus/Deficit' published in line with IMF's Government Financial Statistics Manual and our fiscal presentation in the Budget Statement. For example, 'Cash Surplus/Deficit':
Includes Net Capital Receipts (e.g. monies from land sales net of land-related expenditure);
Includes Net Investment Income
Excludes Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC). IMF excludes the NIRC as it is not a cashflow but a fiscal rule.
Excludes monies committed to Government Funds (e.g. Pioneer Generation Fund, GST Voucher Fund); and
Excludes Government grants given to Statutory Boards that are within the scope of General Government under IMF reporting guidelines.",1.124253,5.7761683,2021,6,Finance (Read: CPF & Reserves),No target; Clarification
2020-08-31,Clarification on Yeoh Lian Chuan's post on Ministry of Finance Addendum to the President's Address,"Mr Yeoh had only reproduced one sentence, and left out the preceding sentence which provides the context for the statement",Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/clarification-on-yeoh-lian-chuan-s-post-on-ministry-of-finance-addendum-to-the-president-s-address/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/552cc549-0917-4106-8cc1-ea2747cd1a35/Factually-MOF-addendum.png,"In his FB post dated 29 August 2020, Mr Yeoh Lian Chuan took issue with the statement by Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Minister for Finance in Ministry of Finance Addendum to the President's Address that 'We have used a generation's worth of savings to combat a crisis of a generation.'
Mr Yeoh said: ''¦by any sensible measure of national savings, a $50+bn draw on past reserves does not represent anything close to a generation's worth of savings'.^
Two points should be highlighted:
First, Mr Yeoh did not set out the full quote. He only reproduced one sentence, and left out the preceding sentence which provides the context for the statement;
Second, Mr Yeoh then went on to talk about 'national savings', which is not what the original quote refers to.
To clarify, the full paragraph in the Ministry of Finance Addendum says:
'To combat this crisis, we have drawn on our reserves, equivalent to over twenty years of past budget surpluses.  We have used a generation's worth of savings to combat a crisis of a generation.  We must therefore ensure that our fiscal balance is put back on a stable path when the economy recovers.'
It is clear from the full quote that the 'generation worth of savings' refers to the over twenty years' worth of past budget surpluses.
'Budget surpluses' refer to the excess of Government's overall revenue over overall expenditure. They are Government savings.
National savings is a broader concept which further includes savings from businesses and households.
Business and household savings are not available to the government for budget spending, whether to combat Covid-19 or otherwise.
The total of our budget surpluses from 1996 to 2019 is $52.3b.
The amount drawn from the reserves to combat Covid-19 is $52b.
The data for these figures are publicly available.
The intent of the Addendum was to inform the public that the amount drawn from the reserves to combat Covid-19 is equivalent to the amount of cumulative budget surpluses over more than twenty years (the broader point being that funds which are hard earned and built up over a long period of time can be used up very quickly) and to remind ourselves of the need for fiscal prudence.
The meaning of the Addendum is clear when the quote is read in full, and without conflating with concepts not present in the original text.
Ë This refers to Mr Yeoh's original Facebook post on 29 August, at 11.01 am. Mr Yeoh subsequently updated his Facebook post on 29 August 2020, at 2.38 pm to say: ''¦ by any sensible measure of national savings, a S$50+bn draw on past reserves does not represent anything close to a generation's worth of government savings'¦'.",1.2310922,6.4695187,2020,6,Finance (Read: CPF & Reserves),Yeoh Lian Chuan
2020-07-29,Clarifications on help for elderly cleaning lady,Community partners play an important role in caring and supporting persons in need,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/clarifications-on-help-for-elderly-cleaning-lady/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/db5bba42-449d-4a88-90f1-4a56b981622e/caringhands.jpg,"A Facebook post has been circulating about a member of public's encounter on the train with an elderly woman who works as a cleaner. The elderly woman was quoted as saying that she was seeking additional employment to earn a living.
Background to elderly woman's situation
The Ministry of Social and Family Development's (MSF) Social Service Office (SSO) has identified the elderly woman, Mdm L. She is staying in a five-room flat with her son's family. The family has a domestic helper. Her son provides her with food and shelter but she works to supplement her other expenses. SSO officers visited her to see if she needed any help and how she can be supported.
Government records show that Mdm L is a permanent resident, and she has not applied for citizenship in the past. Prior to the COVID-19 circuit breaker, Mdm L received a monthly gross salary of about $1,300 (excluding CPF) from her employer. Due to reduced business volume, her employer had arranged for her and other full-time employees to work part-time as a way to retain staff.  She is currently paid $675 for working part-time in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50/hr). MSF understands from her employer that when business improves, they will review and reinstate the cleaners' part-time employment to full-time.
Support for Mdm L
To mitigate the impact of Mdm L's wage loss during this difficult period, MSF is assessing her eligibility for the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), which provides monthly payouts of $500 - $800.
As a non-citizen, she does not qualify for Silver Support or Workfare. However, she receives benefits like the Solidarity Payment that are also extended to PRs.  In addition, she will be supported in other ways. Grassroots organisations will support her with $120 food vouchers monthly for the next six months.  MSF is also arranging for her to get some help for her medical expenses.
The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has verified that Mdm L's elder son, a regular warrant officer, died during a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) freefall training session in South Africa, in May 2009. Full compensation was paid out to his family. MINDEF and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family.
How you can help
Building an inclusive and a caring society is a collective effort. MSF appreciates the effort of members of the public in reaching out to those who seem to be in need.  However, posting and sharing their circumstances on social media may lead to further distress for these vulnerable groups of people and their families. Such posts may not correctly reflect the circumstances of vulnerable groups of people, who may be elderly, or may not share all the details accurately because of the stressors they are facing.
Members of the public are encouraged to link them up directly with MSF through the SSOs or any Family Service Centre. In the case of Mdm L, she indicated she was unaware of being photographed or that her comments and photo would be shared in public on social media.

Referring to a People's Association (PA) Workplan Seminar, the TOC insinuates that it has evidence of the Government's plans to increase the population of Singapore to 10 million. There is no basis for this allegation. The Government has already clarified that it does not seek to achieve any particular population size.
The TOC article referred to a PA document used at the seminar, and also stated that the Dean of the National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI), Mr Foong Hin Cheong, had 'explicitly said that Singaporeans must be prepared to be outnumbered by foreigners given the sharp influx'. Mr Foong did not say this.
Mr Foong was speaking to PA staff at our annual division workplan meeting. PA regularly takes stock of the key trends in Singapore that are relevant to our mission of strengthening social cohesion in Singapore. This allows us to identify and address relevant opportunities and challenges early and decisively. One of the key trends discussed at this meeting was how to address the greater diversity in our community, including foreigners who are living among us in our neighbourhoods. Promoting harmonious living among residents of different backgrounds has always been part of PA's mission to strengthen social cohesion in Singapore. There is therefore no basis for TOC's allegation.

2020-07-06,Why do we need skilled foreign workers in Singapore? These Employment Pass holders compete with Singaporeans for good jobs.,Employment Passes allow companies to bring in foreign professionals to plug skills gaps and supply shortages.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/why-do-we-need-skilled-foreign-workers-in-singapore/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/e2173ee7-ba03-40c4-b535-a17243f37e70/CBD-Workers4-blur.jpg,"Employment Passes allow companies to bring in foreign professionals to plug skills gaps and supply shortages, so as to attract and root high-value activities in Singapore. This is necessary to create and sustain a wide range of good jobs that meet Singaporeans' career aspirations.
For example, to develop our ICT and software industries, which require highly specialised skills and knowledge, global companies like Google, Grab, and Facebook need workers with the relevant skills and experience to fill all the jobs they create. There may not be enough Singapore citizens with these skills and experience to anchor these global companies' investment. Hence, Government should do as the previous generation did to anchor the electronics industry, which was to create the jobs in Singapore first, even if some of these higher-paying jobs went to foreigners initially, and to train Singapore citizens and upgrade their skills to eventually take on these higher-paying jobs.
To ensure that Singapore citizens do not have their salaries undercut by foreigners, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) requires Employment Pass applicants to meet salary thresholds, which are regularly updated taking reference from the salaries of locals with similar experience and seniority. For example, the Employment Pass minimum qualifying salary will be raised from $3,600 to $3,900 with effect from 1 May 2020. The salary thresholds for older and more experienced applicants will also be raised in tandem. For example, an EP applicant in his early 40s will need to earn around double the new minimum qualifying salary of $3,900.
MOM also requires employers to make jobs accessible to Singapore citizens, and recruit fairly based on merit. Under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), employers must advertise on
MyCareersFuture.sg
before they make an Employment Pass application.
MOM also proactively identifies employers that are suspected to have discriminatory hiring practices, and places them on the FCF Watchlist. Their Employment Pass applications are closely scrutinised by MOM, and uncooperative employers have had their work pass privileges withdrawn.
In January 2020, MOM strengthened the FCF by raising penalties across the board for all discrimination cases (including age, race, nationality and mental health condition). Employers that violate the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) will be barred from hiring new foreign workers and renewing existing foreign workers, for a minimum of 12 months up to a maximum of 24 months. MOM will also prosecute employers and key personnel who make false declarations on fair consideration. If convicted, they could face up to 2 years of imprisonment, fined up to $20,000, or both.
Members of the public who encounter workplace discrimination should report it to TAFEP. Beyond the employers, MOM will also take individual employees to task if they were involved in any unfair hiring practices, including revoking their work passes if they are foreigners.
With effect from 1 October 2020, all employment agencies (EAs) will be subject to new licence conditions that require them to comply with the fair recruitment requirements in the TGFEP when recruiting on behalf of their clients.
In addition to helping their clients fulfil job advertising requirements, EAs must also (i) brief their clients on the fair recruitment requirements in the TGFEP; (ii) make reasonable efforts to attract Singaporeans for vacancies that they are trying to fill, except where the employer undertakes to do so through other channels; and (iii) consider all candidates based on merit. EAs that fail to comply with licence conditions may be issued with demerit points, have their licence suspended or revoked, or face prosecution.",1.9169679,4.902379,2020,2,"Employment (Read: Cost of Living, Foreigners)",No target; Explainer
2020-07-06,Common Misinterpretations of Labour Market Statistics,Understanding how labour market statistics should be interpreted is necessary in order to draw appropriate inferences from the data. Here are some common misinterpretations and clarifications on how to read them.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/common-misinterpretations-of-labour-market-statistics/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/adf6d60f-999d-4a0c-981a-2411325365d0/MOM-labour-stats-article.jpg,"The Manpower Research and Statistics Department at the Ministry of Manpower publishes Labour Market Reports on a quarterly basis. The reports include findings from a comprehensive set of statistical indicators to provide a timely sense of labour market conditions.
Understanding what these indicators mean, and how trends should be interpreted is necessary in order to draw appropriate inferences from the data. Here are some common misinterpretations of labour market statistics:
The increase in employment is not the same as the number of jobs being created
In general, employment increase follows from job creation, but they are not the same because:
(a) Jobs could be created but have yet to be filled;
(b) An employed person could hold multiple jobs; and
(c) Employment increase shows the number of persons who took on jobs, after netting of those who left employment during the same time period.
Taken together, the number of jobs created could be more than the increase in employment.
Not employed '  unemployed
Persons who are not employed can be:
(a) Unemployed persons ' people who are not working, but actively looking for a job and available for work; or
(b) Persons outside the labour force ' people who are neither employed nor unemployed, and could be involved in activities other than work e.g. retired, caring for children or the elderly, full-time studies.
This is in line with the statistical definitions recommended by the International Labour Organisation.
A higher unemployment rate does not necessarily mean lower employment growth
An increase in unemployment need not necessarily be due to persons who left employment. Unemployment can increase when persons who were previously outside the labour force begin looking for work (e.g. fresh graduates or re-entrants to the labour market).
The unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of unemployed persons to the labour force, comprising the employed and the unemployed. It is not derived by taking 100% minus the proportion of persons in employment.
A rise in retrenchments does not equate to a rise in unemployment
Retrenchment occurs when employees are made redundant in their existing job roles. This can be due to various reasons such as restructuring, recession or high costs. Retrenchments may occur even in periods of economic growth, when companies restructure and reorganise.
A rise in retrenchment does not equate to a rise in unemployment, nor a decline in total employed persons. This is because:
(a) Retrenchment is one of the many factors that can lead to unemployment. Besides retrenchment, people may leave their jobs for other reasons such as resignations, and expiry of employment contract. Unemployment can also occur when persons enter the labour force, as previously indicated.
(b) Retrenched workers could re-enter employment when they take up another job, or leave the labour force (e.g. to take a break).
Use seasonally adjusted data for indicators with strong seasonal patterns
Data may show seasonal patterns, that is, variations within the year, which repeat quite regularly from year to year. For indicators with strong seasonal patterns, comparisons between consecutive periods, e.g. quarters, should be done using the seasonally adjusted series. If not, it can lead to erroneous conclusions.
For instance, unemployment rates are typically higher in June, when fresh graduates enter the labour market and students look for vacation jobs. If we compare June's unemployment rate with March's unemployment rate, we may observe that the unemployment rate has increased, but this may not be the case after we account for seasonal patterns. For indicators such as unemployment which show strong seasonal patterns, seasonally adjusted data should be used to compare across periods (e.g. between March and June), while non-seasonally adjusted data can be used to compare between the same period across years.

2020-07-05,Unemployment in Singapore,There have been questions about Singapore's unemployment numbers recently. Here are the facts about unemployment in Singapore...,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/unemployment-in-singapore/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/987405a7-a653-47ab-b9b1-c182fb964e8b/cbd-buildings-4.jpg,"In line with international definitions set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the unemployment rate published by the Ministry of Manpower refers to the unemployed as a proportion of the labour force (i.e. those working or seeking work). This is unlike the employment rate, which is expressed as a percentage of the working-age population.
Defining employment and unemployment rates:
Employment Rate - Percentage of employed persons to the working age population
Unemployment Rate - Percentage of unemployed persons to the labour force
The unemployment rate measures untapped labour supply and tells us how well persons who are not working, actively seeking work and available to work, can find work. Persons who are not seeking work, or are unavailable to work are excluded from the calculation.
What do 'seasonally adjusted' and 'non-seasonally adjusted' mean? Why do we use both to report unemployment numbers?
Non-seasonally adjusted data are the 'raw' numbers that have not been adjusted for seasonal patterns, while seasonally-adjusted data remove the impact of seasonal influences on the data. Seasonality refers to intra-year (monthly, quarterly) variations in a time series which repeat in the same period each year, such as fresh graduates entering the job market typically in June.
Seasonal patterns exist in unemployment, making it difficult for us to tell if changes in unemployment are a true reflection of the underlying trend (e.g. economic conditions) or merely due to seasonal influences. To present a more accurate picture, seasonal adjustment is carried out.
Why is Singapore's non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate typically higher in June compared to other periods of the year?
In Singapore, the unemployment rate is usually higher in June, when fresh graduates enter the labour market and students look for vacation jobs. This recurring seasonal variation happens every year. If we directly compare the non-seasonally adjusted unemployment numbers from June with the numbers from another month (such as March) when there isn't such a big influx of job seekers, it would look like a big increase in unemployment. Subsequently, in the later part of the year, the unemployment rate usually declines as graduates find work and students return to school.
This seasonal pattern makes it difficult for us to tell if a rise or fall in the unemployment rate is a true reflection of the underlying trend or merely due to seasonal influences. Hence, to compare unemployment rates between different periods in the same year, we should look at the seasonally-adjusted data to remove the impact of seasonal influences.
What do we mean by employment growth? With high employment growth, would unemployment decrease?
Employment growth refers to the additional number of persons who are in employment, derived by taking the difference in the employment level at the end of the reference period compared with the end of the preceding period. To put it simply, it is not gross job creation, but the increase in the number of people who are employed which, conceptually, is the difference between people entering and exiting employment.
While employment growth measures the additional number of persons in employment, unemployment measures the number of persons who are not in employment but are actively seeking and available for jobs. Unemployment can vary due to changes in demand or supply of manpower. Hence, high employment growth may not necessarily translate to lower unemployment.
Unemployment can decline if more people succeed in finding jobs or if unemployed persons stop looking for a job and leave the labour force either temporarily (e.g. to take up training) or permanently (e.g. to retire). Conversely, unemployment may rise due to an increase in jobseekers (e.g. laid off workers, fresh graduates or re-entrants to the labour market) or if more people quit their jobs to look for alternative employment.
For example:
Unemployment rate could DECLINE if:
More people secure employment;
Unemployed persons stop their job search.
Unemployment rate could RISE if:
There is an increase in jobseekers;
More people quit to find alternate employment.

Falsehoods
The NUSS forum video, TOC's Facebook post and videos, CNA online article and New Naratif audio recording featured the following claims by Dr Paul Tambyah:
MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they would lose their work pass privileges.
MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers.
MOM made these decisions without consulting public health medical professionals or MOH.
The statements above are false for the following reasons:
In its advisory to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: 'Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital.'
The MOM advisory also did not state that employers who brought their workers for testing would lose their work pass privileges. What MOM said was: 'Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly. We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it. Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facility may have their work pass privileges suspended.'
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce, led by the Minister's and staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals, was set up in Jan 2020 to direct the national whole-of-government response to COVID-19, to ensure smooth coordination across Ministry's and all affected sectors.
Decisions made on the management of foreign workers and advisories, including the decision to issue the above MOM advisory to employers, were guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation.
In a Facebook post [1] on 25 April 2020, Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo clarified that the MOM advisory was 'to ask employers not to send their workers who are healthy for testing' at hospitals, that 'Our regular doctors are better able to pick up early signs and order tests if necessary', and that the advisory was sent out at the request of MOH. As the Minister's Facebook post was published before Dr Paul Tambyah's remarks, Dr Tambyah could have easily verified beforehand what the correct facts were.
Additional Clarifications
On 8 February 2020, Changi General Hospital (CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. The employer also asked for memos from CGH to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of well workers being sent to A&E Departments, distracting hospitals from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they are not unwell.
Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time, which was also in line with MOH's risk-based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who are of high risk.
The same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment.

Several Facebook posts ' Singapore Democratic Party, The Online Citizen Asia, Sin Rak Sin Party, Lim Tean of Peoples Voice (Facebook Live video), Louis Chng, and a website article (The Online Citizen Asia) have claimed that Dr Cheong Koon Hean, Chief Executive Officer of the Housing & Development Board, had confirmed that our population would go up to about 10 million by 2030. They cite a lecture by Dr Cheong at the IPS-Nathan Lectures in April 2018.
The Facebook Live video by Lim Tean of Peoples Voice also claims that the Government was planning, or had intentions, to move towards 10 million population by 2030, referencing the same lecture by Dr Cheong.
These allegations are false. Dr Cheong made no statement suggesting that our population would increase to 10 million by 2030. This is a continuation of falsehoods alleging that the Government has a population target of 10 million, which the Government has clarified.
Clarifications
The context of Dr Cheong's lecture in 2018 was on how Singapore can continue to be a highly liveable city should
living density
in Singapore increase to 13,700 persons per square kilometre by 2030. Dr Cheong referred to living density, which takes into account only the land available for urban areas, and excludes land used for ports, airports, and defence, among others. It is therefore inaccurate and misleading to extrapolate a population size of 10 million by applying the living density figure to the total area of Singapore.
Two of the posts refer to a forum letter in the Straits Times in April 2018. Significantly, HDB had replied to this letter, clarifying that Dr Cheong had referred to living density and not population density ('Living density different from population density'):
https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/living-density-different-from-population-density.
The Government has not proposed, planned nor targeted for Singapore to increase its population to 10 million.
The Government has clarified Singapore's population plans on multiple occasions: (i) in Parliament in March 2018, when it stated that Singapore's total population is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030, (ii) in two Factually articles ('

This is false for the following reasons:
The Government has not proposed, planned nor targeted for Singapore to increase its population to 10 million;
The Government does not have any population target; and
URA's underground plans are not meant to serve any population target.

Facts
We wish to clarify that the telephone call between the two Prime Minister's was initiated at the request of Prime Minister Muhyiddin. As Prime Minister Muhyiddin has publicly stated, he proposed that the Singapore Government consider a daily cross-border commuting arrangement.
The Singapore Government is committed to discussing the gradual and phased resumption of cross-border travel with Malaysia, subject to mutually agreed public health protocols, to preserve the public health and safety of citizens of both countries. Singapore and Malaysia are working on the Periodic Commuting Arrangement and the Reciprocal Green Lane, and officials on both sides will continue discussions on other proposals to gradually facilitate more cross-border movement of people, while taking into account the medical resources available in both countries.

The NTS page is run by Mr Alex Tan, who lives in Australia, and claims to be an Australian citizen.
Falsehoods
On 15 May 2020, NTS published a post, claiming, amongst other things, the following:
'Every criticism has been outlawed by the Singapore government through its new POFMA
1
legislation, where the politicians in power get to decide what is truth.'
The Minister for Law had issued a POFMA direction to ban a video.
The above are false, for the following reasons:
It is false that 'politicians in power get to decide what is truth' under POFMA. This had previously been explained when an earlier POFMA direction was issued. POFMA applies only to factual statements that are false (Section 2(2) of POFMA). It does not apply to opinions. If there is a dispute as to whether the statement is false, or whether it is a statement of fact, the dispute can be determined by the Courts. The Courts have, over centuries, developed criteria for assessing falsehoods, and will be the final arbiters of whether there is a falsehood under POFMA.
For the reasons above, it is therefore also untrue to say that POFMA outlaws
every criticism
of the Government. Before and after POFMA came into force, the Government has been regularly criticised on various matters. These criticisms have not been subject to POFMA.
The Minister for Law has not issued a POFMA direction to ban any video. The video subject to an earlier POFMA direction remains accessible to the public.
Additional Clarifications
Mr Tan repeats falsehoods that were subject to an earlier POFMA direction. In light of that earlier direction, Mr Tan must be aware that these statements are false and tend to undermine the public interest. Yet, he continues to publish falsehoods that distort the public's understanding of the law and how it has been implemented.
Mr Tan makes serious and baseless allegations about Singapore's judiciary being biased. These have been brought to the attention of the Attorney-General's Chambers for assessment on whether the allegations are in contempt of court.
Mr Tan also claims that the Minister for Law faces criminal charges in Malaysia, and that a Malaysian court has made an order against the Minister for Law. These are untrue.
Mr Tan has previously been issued POFMA correction directions in relation to falsehoods conveyed on 6 separate occasions on his previous Facebook pages, the States Times Review and Singapore States Times. This demonstrates a clear pattern of deliberately spreading falsehoods which affect the public interest. The majority of these falsehoods related to the COVID-19 situation, including falsehoods suggesting that Singapore had run out of face masks, that there was an underreporting of COVID-19 cases here by the Government, that there were numerous infections because schools were not closed earlier and that foreign workers were not getting paid during quarantine.
Mr Tan was bound to comply with these correction directions, but has refused to comply. His previous pages were declared as declared online locations (Section 32 of POFMA) and subject to access disabling orders (Section 34 of POFMA) after his repeated non-compliance with the law. Mr Tan remains recalcitrant, and continues to purvey falsehoods, on his latest page.

Falsehoods
On 8 May 2020, Mr Thum published a YouTube video episode of The Show by PJ Thum on the New Naratif YouTube channel, claiming, amongst other things, the following.
Under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), the definition of 'false' means that
'even if one bit is found to be wrong or misleading, the whole statement can be considered false. The definition is so broad that the omission of a fact, accidentally or otherwise, is sufficient for something to be considered misleading. The problem is, it's impossible to include every single fact about anything in the statement. You can't! And even if you could, anyone could selectively quote it, so that what they quote is misleading. So under this law, every statement can be considered false in some way
'.
POFMA makes all criticisms of the Government illegal.
There is no recourse in law for the Court to overturn a POFMA direction if it is an abuse of the powers under POFMA.
POFMA '
means that the truth will be whatever the party says it is
'.
1
The above are false, for the following reasons:
POFMA applies only to factual statements that are false (Section 2(2) of POFMA). It does not apply to opinions. If there is a dispute as to whether the statement is false, or whether it is a statement of fact, the dispute can be determined by the Courts. Further, the whole statement will not be considered false, automatically, just because '
one bit
' of it is false. The Courts have, over centuries, developed criteria for assessing falsehoods. It is untrue to say that '
every statement can be considered false in some way
' and be subject to POFMA.
Criticisms which are opinions and not statements of fact are not covered by POFMA (Section 2(2)(a) of POFMA). Criticisms which are based on true facts, are also not covered by POFMA. POFMA only applies to falsehoods. It is untrue (and absurd) to say that POFMA makes
 all criticisms
of the Government illegal. Before and after POFMA came into force, there have been criticisms of the Government (including by Mr Thum), on a regular basis. They have not been the subject of POFMA.
The Courts have judicial oversight of the exercise of powers under POFMA. It is therefore untrue to say that there can be no recourse in law, when there has been abuse of POFMA powers
For the above reasons, it is also false for Mr Thum to assert that POFMA '
means that the truth will be whatever the party says it is
.'
1
Mr Thum also states that POFMA has been used against the 'interpretation of statistical data' by the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). This is also false. The issue was not about interpretation of statistics. The SDP had made a direct, false statement. (See MOM's
clarification
 in the said SDP case.)  SDP challenged the POFMA directions against it, and the High Court held that there was no basis for the directions to be set aside, because SDP had made false statements of fact. The High Court's judgment is
publicly available
.
Additional Clarifications
Contrary to what Mr Thum suggests, people are free to criticise and disagree with the Government.
POFMA has been used to deal specifically with falsehoods, which suggested that the Government is mismanaging public funds, abusing police power, favouring foreigners over locals, and carrying out judicial executions in an unlawful, brutal manner, among others. The consequences that such falsehoods about public institutions can have on society were extensively set out in the
Government's Green Paper
, the
Select Committee Report
, and the
Second Reading speech for POFMA
. Those interested can look at this material and form their own views as to whether, as Mr Thum claims, POFMA has been used in a manner inconsistent with government assurances.
POFMA has enabled these falsehoods to be corrected in a targeted manner. Powers under POFMA are in fact narrower than pre-existing legislation dealing with falsehoods.
Further, so far, the primary approach has been to issue Correction Directions under POFMA.
2
Where a Correction Direction has been issued, the original article
remains completely accessible
. Readers can read for themselves both the primary piece and the correction, and make up their own minds. Recipients of POFMA directions who put up the Correction Notice can continue to put forward their point of view on the issue, and their original articles also remain available for anyone to read.
POFMA was used against COVID-19-related falsehoods in 11 of the 18 POFMA cases to date. In 7 of these cases, directions were issued within 24 hours, sometimes in a matter of hours.
Mr Thum states that the court process takes a long time. But, as the Government has said, POFMA's Rules provide for the High Court hearing to be held 6 working days after the originating summons is filed in court, which is expedited, compared with the usual process which could take some months.  As the Government has also said, there are no hearing fees for the first three days (if the hearing does take three days), and the Court will have the power to waive any further fees. For individuals, filing fees are lower than ordinary court fees. The Government had also explained that how long the hearing takes, and how long the Courts take to decide, are matters for the Courts; Parliament and the Executive cannot intervene in those.
Mr Thum also misleadingly uses a video clip of an interview with the Minister for Law to suggest that POFMA can be easily abused by a future government. He  omits the first part of the Minister's answer, which is that '
first of all, there are checks'¦ the courts have oversight of it. So there is a clear oversight mechanism (and) checks.
'
Contrary to what Mr Thum said, the Government did not try to apply the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act retroactively in Mr Li Shengwu's case. The substantive law applicable to the case was common law contempt, and not the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act.
Mr Thum claims that '
past PAP governments have spread misinformation to silence critics, like in Operation Spectrum
.' These are his opinions (and thus not subject to a POFMA Direction).  Similar claims have been refuted elsewhere.
Public clarifications on POFMA have been put out by the Government, repeatedly. Yet, in the past year, Mr Thum has on multiple occasions repeated falsehoods and misleading statements similar to those in this case. He is clearly aware of what the true scope of POFMA is: when a viewer asked whether his criticisms of the government may be false, he shrugged off the suggestion, stating that '
POFMA is supposed to only be used against 'false statements of facts',
'

meaning, his opinions cannot be the subject of POFMA.  Thus his statements (set out in para 2 above), that POFMA can be used in respect of
all statements
, are entirely cynical, and he obviously knows that they are untrue.
Under the Correction Directions issued to Mr Thum and New Naratif, the 8 May video can remain accessible to the public. That gives the lie to any suggestion of censorship. It will allow viewers to view his video, and this statement, and reach their own conclusions.

Falsehood
On 4 May 2020, SST published a Facebook post stating that
'Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools. The schools were only closed on April 3rd, but at least 50 students and teachers were already infected.'
These statements imply that at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false.
As of 3 April 2020, 69 students and staff in MOE schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19. Based on contact tracing and investigations by MOH, all the cases (except for 3 which are still unlinked) were attributed to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings, and a non-school workplace (for a part-time student). In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs.
Additional Clarifications
Even before the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) as part of the broader national Circuit Breaker measures, our schools and teachers have put in tremendous effort to ensure that our students can learn in a safe environment. Precautionary measures included establishing new hygiene and cleaning routines for our students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, and placing students who are unwell, have a travel history, or who stay with family members who have a travel history, on a Leave of Absence.
As part of the national Circuit Breaker measures, schools were closed and we moved to Full HBL on 8 April 2020. With most parents telecommuting from home, the closure of schools did not become a major disruption to our lives. Although students no longer attend school physically, the restrictions in place prevented them from moving around the community freely and exposing themselves to the virus.  Nevertheless, a major concern with school closure is our students from vulnerable backgrounds, who need the support of schools for lessons, meals and guidance. These students, together with students whose parents work in essential services, have therefore been allowed to come back to school for care and supervision, with the necessary safe distancing measures in place. The arrangements for these students will continue during the May school holidays.
If MOE had simply closed schools early, say from Feb 2020, we would have disrupted lives significantly, and the impact on students from vulnerable backgrounds would have been immense.  Instead, we have kept schools open as long as possible, while keeping our students safe.",4.3719015,4.3873925,2020,7,Health (Read: Covid),Alex Tan

Falsehoods
The Authors made various claims that the annual salary of Temasek CEO Ms Ho Ching is 'NT$ 2.1 billion', 'about 100 million SGD' or 'S$99 million a year'.
All of the above claims are false. Please refer to
https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/statements/2020/temasek-compensation-framework
.
Additional Clarifications
The Government does not set the remuneration of staff in Temasek; this is the responsibility of its Board and management. The Government holds the Board responsible for the long-term performance of its investments, net of expenses.
In the case of Temasek, its Board Committee, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee ('LDCC'), is responsible for the establishment of guidelines and policies on performance measurement and compensation plans. In addition, remuneration of the Executive Directors of Temasek Holdings is approved by LDCC and endorsed by its Board.
Temasek's remuneration framework balances reward for short-term performance and long-term value creation. This has been disclosed in Temasek's Review since 2008. Temasek's compensation is benchmarked to the industry and the compensation framework comprises a base salary, as well as short-term, medium-term and long-term incentives. Part of the bonuses are deferred and subject to clawback should Temasek's returns be negative. Temasek has also publicly stated that Ms Ho Ching's annual compensation is neither the highest within Temasek, nor is she amongst the top five highest paid executives in Temasek.

Falsehoods
On 18 April 2020, Singapore States Times published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:
The number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection on 17 April was 1,146, and the total number of confirmed cases was 5,573;
Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic, by reporting numbers in the afternoon instead of later at night;
The Singapore Government earlier covered up the number of uncontactable suspect cases, then covered up the flight information and profiles of imported cases, and subsequently tried to cover up the total number of cases by reporting only the number of discharged cases and daily increases; and
The States Times Review (STR) had called out the Government and Ministry of Health (MOH) on the cover up and MOH had to comply with STR's post.
The above are false, for the following reasons:
There were 623 new cases of COVID-19 infection as of 12pm on 17 April 2020, which brought the total number of cases to 5,050. It is false that there were 1,146 new cases. There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19.
There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH's daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing. MOH also publishes reports on the daily situation as well as an overview of the cases via the case summary table and dashboard which can be publicly accessed on MOH's website.
MOH does not act and has not acted in compliance with any of STR's posts.
Additional Clarifications
Contact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase. As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e., the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue. Subsequently, further updates and details of those cases are shared via the MOH press release issued later on the same night.

Falsehood
TTR said in their post: ""Grabfood delivery rider issued summon by SPF officers of fine of $300 for alleged wearing cloth as mask or illegal parking?""
This is false. The police officers were in fact rendering assistance to the delivery rider who had approached them for help. The GrabFood delivery rider had thought that items were stolen from his motorcycle and approached the Police officers for help. The Police officer in the photo of TTR's Facebook post was actually taking a statement from the delivery rider. No summons was issued to the delivery rider, and the event had nothing to do with the circuit breaker measures or illegal parking.
Such allegations are highly irresponsible and hurt public confidence and trust in the Police. It also undermines our officers, who are at the frontlines trying to keep Singaporeans safe and secure during this challenging period. Let us stand united, instead of sowing division and discord.

é' ('tifinnytara') dated 29 Mar 2020, concerning Singapore's Resilience Budget (Supplementary Budget 2020) (""Resilience Budget"").
Falsehoods
I. Source of funding for Singapore Airlines' S$15 billion capital raising exercise
In the Facebook post, the author stated, ""Don't be too happy that you have $48b. The bulk of almost 1/3 goes to SIA, 55% TEMASEK OWNED (how did our national carrier became temasek own at 55%???). Cash n immediate release to SIA!' The author has claimed that almost one third of the support provided under the Resilience Budget will be provided to Singapore Airlines (""SIA""). This is false.
SIA's S$15 billion capital raising exercise, announced on 26 March 2020, is distinct and separate from the Resilience Budget, and is not funded by the Government.
II. Use of S$17 billion from Past Reserves
The author also stated in the Facebook Post, ""...president halimah open reserves of $17b is mainly for Temasek.' In this statement, the author has claimed that the S$17 billion from Singapore's Past Reserves will be used mainly for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (""Temasek""). This is also false.
To support the Resilience Budget, the Government is proposing to draw up to S$17 billion from our Past Reserves for broad-based economy-wide and sector-wide schemes. The schemes drawing on Past Reserves are:
Economy-wide Support Measures
Enhancement of Jobs Support Scheme (S$13.8b)
Enhancement of financing schemes (S$1.7b)
Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (S$1.2b)
Sector-wide Support Measure
Aviation Support Package (S$0.4b)
None of the above schemes are ring-fenced to be for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited ('Temasek') or Temasek-linked companies.
Additional Clarifications
The Government has set aside a total of S$48.4 billion in the Resilience Budget to (i) save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods, (ii) help enterprises overcome immediate challenges, and (iii) strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger.
In particular, S$20.0 billion has been set aside in the form of loan capital, to support good companies with strong capabilities and to catalyse private sector loan capital. None of this S$20 billion set aside as loan capital will be used by the Government to subscribe to SIA's fund-raising exercise announced on 26 March 2020.
S$13.8 billion will go towards enhancing and extending the Jobs Support Scheme (""JSS""), to provide more impactful and sustained wage support for businesses. The JSS covers all sectors, with severely impacted sectors such as aviation, tourism and Food and Beverages ('F&B') getting additional support. Eligible individuals and households will also benefit under the new Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, as well as the enhanced Care and Support Package.

Falsehoods
On 19 February 2020, Goh published a Facebook post alleging that a single mother 'Lina' and her six children had been evicted from their rental flat due to rental default, and that they have been staying at her sister's house.
On 21 February 2020, TISG published an article and Facebook post on 'Lina' reiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details.
The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons:
First, HDB did not evict 'Lina' from her rental flat. 'Lina' was previously living in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did not have any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy. 'Lina''s husband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned the keys to HDB in early February 2020.
Second, 'Lina' and her husband have bought a new flat from HDB, which has been paid for in full. 'Lina' and her family have since moved into their new HDB flat.
Additional Clarifications
When HDB staff visited 'Lina' and her husband in their new flat on 22 February 2020, the couple explained that it was a relative who had approached Goh for assistance.
'Lina' and her family have been receiving assistance, including cash, vouchers, subsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community partners ' the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family Service Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from their local grassroots organisation.
HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no other housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies and community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres, to provide support to rental tenants.
The false statements reported by Goh and TISG give the impression that HDB has deprived a needy family of public rental housing because of their inability to pay for it.

Falsehoods
On 13 February 2020, STR published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:
The Government is unable to trace the source of infection for any of the infected COVID-19 cases in Singapore;
The Government is ""the only one"" telling the public not to wear a mask;
Each ""China worker"" will also get S$100 a day for 14 days of Leave of Absence, fully paid for by the Singapore government;
Minister for Manpower, Mrs Josephine Teo, said that she was working hard to bring more workers from China into Singapore; and
Seven countries have since banned travel to Singapore, citing lack of confidence in the Singapore government's public health measures
The above are entirely false, for the following reasons:
First, as of 12:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, the Ministry of Health (""MOH"") has established through epidemiological investigation and contact tracing that 51 out of the 58 cases have either had travel history to mainland China, or links with previously announced cases. Contact tracing is underway for the remaining seven locally-transmitted cases in an attempt to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.
Second, MOH's advice that there is no need for individuals who are well to wear a mask is in-line with the World Health Organisation's guidance on the use of masks in the community in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities in other countries such as the
US
and Australia have also expressly advised that they do not recommend that masks be worn by people who are well. As a good hygiene practice, people who are unwell and who have respiratory symptoms should wear a mask so that they minimise the risk of them infecting  others.
Third, Chinese Work Pass holders placed on a mandatory 14-day Leave of Absence (""LOA"") do not receive the $100 daily support. Instead, it is their
employer
who would receive the support. Under the Leave of Absence Support Programme (""LOASP""), eligible employers can apply for $100 daily per affected worker for the required duration of paid LOA granted to the worker. The LOASP also covers all workers, regardless of nationality. This includes Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Work Pass holders who have travelled to mainland China on or before 31 January 2020, and who were placed on LOA upon their return to Singapore on or after 31 January 2020.
Fourth, at no time did the Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo say she was working hard to bring more Chinese workers back to Singapore. In fact, the Ministry of Manpower (""MOM"") requires employers of work pass holders with travel history to mainland China to obtain prior approval so as to slow down their workers' return to Singapore. MOM approved about 200 applications daily for planned arrivals between 9 and 12 Feb 2020, giving priority to applications in essential services like healthcare, transport and waste management so that operations in these sectors are not compromised. Many more applications were rejected.
Fifth, as of 8:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, no countries have banned travel to Singapore.
Additional Clarifications
All work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days and who are planning to enter/return to Singapore after 2359 hrs on 8 February 2020, will be required to obtain MOM's prior approval before they commence their journey. This is regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder.
Upon arrival in Singapore, all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will be placed on mandatory 14-day LOA. Employers will have to arrange for suitable premises to house these returning employees for the duration of their LOA.
In addition, the Singapore Government is working in close cooperation with our foreign counterparts. We have been actively sharing information with our foreign counterparts on Singapore's measures to manage COVID-2019. The international community, businesses and visitors, can be confident in Singapore's commitment to share information openly and swiftly, to protect public health and maintain safety and stability. Singapore has been cited as a positive model in respect of our transparency and response to the COVID-2019 outbreak. In particular, the World Health Organization highlighted the strength of Singapore's response, noting that even before the first case in Singapore was detected, preparedness activities were already underway to rapidly detect and respond to the virus.

Mr Tan also posted that Singapore had run out of masks since last Sunday, less than three days after the first confirmed case.
In his Facebook post on 28 January 2020, Dr Lam Pin Min was clearly pictured in a warehouse which showed part of the Government stockpile of surgical masks. His Facebook post also stated clearly that there is sufficient supply of masks if people use them sensibly and responsibly.
Additional clarifications
On 30 January 2020, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said in a press conference that the Singapore Armed Forces would begin packing more than 5.2 million surgical masks this afternoon. The masks would be distributed to local resident households in packets of four surgical masks per household from this Saturday. This clearly indicates that Singapore has not run out of face masks for Singaporeans. During the same press conference, both Minister Lawrence Wong and Mr Chan informed the media that the Government had distributed more than 5 million surgical masks from the stockpile to retailers over the last nine days, which had all been snapped up immediately.
Although the stockpile is currently sufficient to meet the needs of our public healthcare institutions, we must continue to manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation of surgical masks to those who need it the most. This includes our healthcare workers on the frontline and the vulnerable within our society.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry is actively working on identifying new suppliers of surgical masks and will continue to ensure that existing lines of supplies are kept robust.

LFL""
), published on 16 Jan 2020, which alleged the use of unlawful methods in judicial executions conducted in Changi Prison, contains false statements of fact.
Falsehoods
LFL's allegation that the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) applies the alleged procedure for judicial executions is completely baseless
In their statement, LFL falsely asserted that:
'prison officers were instructed to carry out the following brutal procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging, which happens from time to time.
The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.
Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.
The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.
The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.
The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.
Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.'
SPS does not apply the procedure as alleged by LFL for judicial executions. No effort is spared to ensure that all judicial executions in Singapore are carried out in strict compliance with the law. All judicial executions are conducted in the presence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. The law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to conduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution was carried out duly and properly. For the record, the rope used for judicial executions has never broken before. This fact alone shows the falsity of LFL's allegations.
Additional Clarifications
LFL also made spurious allegations that prison officers were 'given special training to carry out the brutal execution method', that the Singapore Government approved of these ""unlawful methods"", and suggested that specific measures were adopted to cover up these methods. These allegations are entirely unfounded.
Prison officers certainly do not receive any 'special training to carry out the brutal execution method' as alleged. Any acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.
These scurrilous allegations of misconduct follow a series of sensational and untrue stories previously published by LFL. LFL has been publishing various falsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death penalty.

2020-01-03,Why are labour market statistics based on residents and not Singapore Citizens,Statistical agencies around the world present labour market statistics for the population residing in the country. Singapore follows a similar practice.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/why-are-labour-market-statistics-based-on-residents-and-not-singapore-citizens/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/1135c075-e1f6-4d01-a3f1-9b0dec4d9b3c/crowdinmotion.jpg,"[Updated as of October 2024]
Labour market statistics are intended to track labour market performance which reflects economic activity. The statistics are wide in coverage to provide a comprehensive picture.
With this intent in mind, statistical agencies worldwide typically cover the population residing in their country when presenting their regular statistical releases, without a breakdown by nationality.  There is also a technical consideration.  Most national statistical agencies do not disaggregate labour statistics by nationality due to limitations of data collection. Surveys conducted with smaller sample sizes often do not contain enough data points for meaningful analysis.
In Singapore, we follow a similar practice to facilitate international comparisons.  We regularly report on Total Employment, Overall Employment Rate, and Overall Unemployment.
We have in fact gone a step further to also present resident labour market statistics (which excludes foreign workers) such as the employment rate for Residents, unemployment rate for Residents, and retrenchment for Residents.
In most instances, there is little value from a statistical standpoint to further decompose resident labour market statistics into Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs). Citizens make up a large majority of the resident labour force, at about 85%. The PR population has also remained stable over time at about 0.5 million.  These two facts taken together means that for the most part, resident data mirrors citizen data, and having citizen data in addition to resident data provides little additional information.
Source: Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Manpower Research & Statistics Department, MOM
Nevertheless, in recognition of public interest and where data is large enough for breakdowns to be meaningful, citizen data may be published.  For example, in reply to a Parliamentary Question in 2016, the Ministry of Manpower reported that SCs make up about 80% of employed PMETs from 2013 to 2015.
Citizen data is also regularly released for key statistics, and the latest data can be found at

Falsehood
Mr Lim states that 'the total pot available to Singaporean students [is] $167 million compared to the $238 million that is spent on foreign students'. He further states that 'PAP spends $167 million on Grants & Bursaries for Singaporeans, but $238 million on foreign students??'. These statements imply that MOE spends less on Singaporean students than on foreign students.
This is false and misleading.
MOE's annual budget is $13B, almost all of which is spent on Singapore citizens. The $167M cited by Mr Lim refers only to bursaries for Singaporean tertiary students, and grossly understates MOE's total spending on Singaporean citizens for education.
The figures of $167M and $238M are therefore not comparable.
The more appropriate comparison should be nearly $13B spent on Singaporean students to provide subsidised education for all Singaporean students at all levels, as against the $238M attributed to foreign students referred to by Mr Lim Tean, which is less than 2% of the total education budget.
Further, it should be noted that much of MOE's budget goes towards costs such as infrastructure, facilities, laboratories, faculty and teaching force, etc., which are either fixed or non-variable up to the medium term, to provide education for Singaporean students. A large part of the $238M attributed to foreign students comprises these fixed and non-variable costs that we have to incur anyway, whether or not we admit a small proportion of foreign students (currently 5%) in the system.
This was explained by the Minister for Education in Parliament on 5 August 2019. [

]
Additional Clarifications
Our admissions system ensures that no Singaporean student is deprived of a place by a foreign student. Having a small proportion of foreign students in our schools and institutions brings diversity into classrooms and helps our students develop cross-cultural competencies, a key skill in today's world.
Likewise, many Singaporean students receive scholarships from, and study in, other countries. We are all part of an inter-connected global ecosystem. Singapore has benefited greatly from establishing such linkages and forming people to people friendships with different countries and cultures. Having some foreign students in our education system enables many more Singaporean students to enjoy similar benefits.

In addition, SDP paid for both posts to be boosted as advertisements on Facebook. Both posts are linked to an article on the SDP's website titled, 'SDP Population Policy: Hire S'poreans First, Retrench S'poreans last'.
One of the Facebook posts includes a graphical illustration depicting plunging 'Local PMET Employment'. In the Court of Appeal's judgment in The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters [2021] SGCA 96 ('
CA Judgment
'), it has been held that the reference to 'Local PMET Employment' in this graphic is to Singapore Citizen PMET employment.
It is wrong that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has decreased. As reported in the Ministry of Manpower's Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Singapore Citizen PMET employment has risen steadily since 2015.
The article on the SDP's website titled, 'SDP Population Policy: Hire S'poreans First, Retrench S'poreans last', contains the statement: 'The SDP's proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched'.
This statement is also wrong. There is no rising trend of local PMET retrenchments. As noted in the CA Judgment, the SDP has accepted that 'local PMET' in the context of this article refers to Singapore Citizen PMETs and Permanent Resident PMETs. The number of local PMETs retrenched in 2018 was, in fact, the lowest since 2014. Local PMETs retrenched, as a proportion of all local PMET employees, has also declined since 2015.
POFMA has been used to place the facts alongside the falsehoods.
FALSEHOODS
The following are falsehoods in SDP's Facebook posts, advertisements, and website.
Falsehood #1: The claim that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has been going down
[Screenshot from SDP's Facebook post]
As found in the CA Judgment, 'Local PMET' in this graphic refers to 'Singapore Citizen PMETs'. This graphic depicts the number of Singapore Citizen PMETs employed as having fallen sharply. This is false.
Fact #1:  the number of Singapore Citizen PMETs employed has increased from about 0.93 million in 2015 to about 1.05 million in 2019.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS) shows that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has risen steadily since 2015.
Source: Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Manpower Research & Statistics Department, MOM
It should be noted that MOM does not usually decompose resident labour market statistics into Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Singapore Citizens make up a large majority of the labour force, at about 85%. The Permanent Resident population has also remained stable over time at about 0.5 million. These two facts taken together means that for the most part, resident data mirrors citizen data, and having citizen data in addition to resident data provides little additional information.
Falsehood #2 - The claim that Singaporean PMET retrenchment has been going up.
The SDP website states that the party's 'proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched'. This statement is false. As found in the CA Judgment, the SDP has, by its statement, asserted that local PMET retrenchment has been increasing, in numerical terms. As noted in the CA Judgment, the SDP has accepted that 'local PMETs' in relation to the SDP's website article refers to Singapore Citizen PMETs and Permanent Resident PMETs.

CLARIFICATION ON FOREIGN PMETS
SDP's graph above also depicts the number of foreign PMETs as having increased sharply in recent years.
The number of Employment Pass (EP) holders has historically fluctuated depending on economic conditions.  EP qualifying salaries are also regularly adjusted to safeguard employment of local PMETs.  As a result, local PMET employment has continued to grow while the number of EP holders in Singapore remained stable, ranging from 187,900 in 2015 to 185,800 in 2018. The figure as of Jun 2019 is 189,000.
Source: Ministry of Manpower
SDP's statements seek to mislead Singaporeans
The Singapore economy is continuing to create jobs despite the economic headwinds. Singapore Citizen PMET employment has increased consistently. There is no rising trend of retrenchment, whether amongst PMETs or otherwise.
Given the current uncertain economic climate, it is understandable that some Singaporeans feel anxious about employment prospects and retrenchments. This makes it all the more critical that public debate on the important issue of jobs is based on accurate facts, and not distortions or falsehoods.
These false and misleading statements by the SDP have a singular objective ' to stoke fear and anxiety among local PMETs. It is important to set the facts straight so that Singaporeans are not misled.

The Facebook post by the States Times Review (""
STR
""), published on 23 Nov 2019, contains false statements of fact.
Falsehoods
No one has been arrested or charged arising from the NSU post
The STR refers to a Facebook post by ""NUSSU ' NUS Students United"" (""NSU"") which had misleadingly quoted Minister K Shanmugam as saying that a political candidate running for elections must resign from all executive positions that they hold in organisations with religious leanings.
The STR falsely asserts that:
'The whistleblower who exposed the PAP candidate's Christian affiliations has since been arrested, and fac[es] Police charges for 'fabricating fake news''; and
The [NSU] page has since been taken down and the owner of the page is now under Police investigation after Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam ordered the arrest.""
These claims are false and baseless. No one has been arrested or charged arising from the NSU post. The Government did not request that Facebook take down the NSU post or disable the page. It was Facebook which removed the page on its own accord. As reported by the Singapore media on 23 Nov 2019, Facebook did so as the NSU page violated authenticity policies, and the fake accounts linked to the page failed Facebook's community and authenticity guidelines.
Additional Clarifications
The STR also has made scurrilous accusations against the Elections Department, the Prime Minister, and the election process in Singapore.
Parliamentary elections in Singapore are governed by the Parliamentary Elections Act. The law provides for a clear and transparent framework which ensures the integrity of the elections. By way of example, there are equal opportunities for all political participants, regardless of party affiliation, to observe and monitor the election process. After the close of polls, the presiding officer is required to secure the ballot boxes and the Candidates or their agents may affix their own seals. Before vote counting even begins, Candidates and their counting agents are allowed to witness the opening of each ballot box and the taking out of the papers therein. Candidates and their counting agents can also be present during the counting of the votes and raise objections on the validity of any vote.

The Facebook post by Mr Brad Bowyer contains false statements of fact and misleading statements.
Falsehoods
I.  Singapore Government's involvement in investment decisions by Temasek and GIC
Mr Bowyer implies that the Singapore Government controls Temasek's and GIC's commercial decisions. This is false.
The Government does not influence, let alone direct, the individual investment decisions made by Temasek and GIC. Which companies they invest in, or divest from, is entirely the responsibility of their respective management teams. The Government likewise does not interfere in the commercial decisions of Temasek's and GIC's portfolio companies.
Temasek and GIC are run on market principles, independent of the Government. Many of their portfolio companies are publicly listed. The Government's role is to ensure that Temasek and GIC have competent boards, which ensure that their respective mandates are met. The Government also holds the boards of Temasek and GIC accountable for their respective overall performances.
II.  Amaravati Project
Mr Bowyer says
''¦we also saw the recent canning of the Amaravati city project part of the S$4 billion already dumped into Andhra Pradesh by GLCs and related parties so India has not been so good an investment choice after all'¦'
. There are implicit factual assertions that (1) a substantial part of S$4 billion invested in Andhra Pradesh was put into the Amaravati project; and (2) S$4 billion has been poorly invested ('dumped') by Government-linked companies ('GLCs') and related parties in Andhra Pradesh. These are false.
First, the Singapore Consortium (comprising Ascendas Singbridge Pte Ltd (now part of CapitaLand Group) and Sembcorp Development Ltd) in the Amaravati project has stated publicly that the costs incurred have been limited to design services prior to commencement of execution works on the ground, amounting to a few million dollars. There are no billions of dollars involved.
Second, not only GLCs and related parties have invested in Andhra Pradesh. Several other Singaporean companies have also done so. An example of a non-GLC investment in Andhra Pradesh is Indus Coffee Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of a listed company in Singapore.
III.  Salt Bae
Mr Bowyer asserts that Temasek invested in the debt-ridden parent company which owns Salt Bae. This is false.
The Salt Bae chain of restaurants is owned by a company called D.ream International BV, which operates 60 restaurants throughout the world via four operating subsidiaries. Temasek invested in D.ream International BV, and not in one of D.ream International BV's shareholders called DoÄuÅ Holding A.Å. The company that is reportedly in difficulties according to the article cited by Mr Bowyer, is DoÄuÅ Holding A.Å., and not D.ream International BV.
Additional Clarifications
Additional clarifications on the points Mr Bowyer has raised are set out below.
Temasek, GIC and public funds
Mr Bowyer uses false and misleading statements to smear the reputation of Temasek and GIC:
Over the past 20 years, Temasek's total shareholder return has been 7% (annualised, in SGD terms). Temasek's overall portfolio has grown from less than S$100 billion in 2002 to over S$300 billion today.
Temasek is subject to market scrutiny and discipline. Since 2004, Temasek has published its financial information annually. Temasek also issues Bonds and Eurocommercial Paper to retail, institutional, accredited and other specified investors as part of its financial discipline. Additionally, Temasek has been rated Aaa by Moody's Investors Service and AAA by S&P Global Ratings, ever since its inaugural ratings in 2004.
Under the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework, the expected returns of Temasek, GIC and MAS together, contribute around 20% of Government revenue currently. The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) is the single largest contributor to Government revenue, exceeding GST.
This contrasts starkly with most other countries. In the United States, 1 out of every 10 dollars of US federal government revenue goes towards servicing interest payments on the federal debt. In Singapore, 1 out of every 5 dollars of revenue spent comes from the returns on our reserves. In other words, instead of having to tax citizens to service interest on government debt, Singapore has managed to increase social and other spending through NIRC from Temasek, GIC and MAS, while keeping taxes low.
Temasek and GIC are managed prudently and competently. No other sovereign wealth funds have contributed so significantly to national budgets and the economy, without relying on natural resources or a large domestic economy.
Keppel
Mr Bowyer suggests Keppel Corporation or its subsidiary has suffered losses due to the $0.5 billion fine imposed. This is misleading.
In the last 33 years, Keppel has made profits every year. In the last 4 years, Keppel has made profits of S$3.4 billion, including a S$196 million net profit in the year when the Brazilian fine was imposed. Keppel has been declaring dividends regularly as a listed company to all its shareholders, including Temasek.
Bharti Airtel
Mr Bowyer refers to Singtel's investment in Bharti Airtel. Singtel's shareholding today is valued at S$13 billion, which is more than double its investment to date of S$5.1 billion. Bharti Airtel faces a number of recent regulatory and Indian Supreme Court decisions. These are matters for Bharti Airtel and Singtel to address.
Amaravati Project
Mr Bowyer suggests that S$4 billion in investments by GLCs and related parties in Andhra Pradesh have all been doing poorly. Mr Bowyer makes this sweeping statement, but gives no basis for it.

Below is MCI and MinLaw's reply to The Online Citizen:
Dear The Online Citizen,
You have published a post by your editor, Mr Terry Xu, and another article by Ghui, on POFMA and GE. Both were published by you on 5 October 2019.

The robust safeguards on the use of POFMA will continue to be in place during the elections.
It is disingenuous to talk about the need for voters to know 'what actually happened', while suggesting that falsehoods should be allowed to go unaddressed during an election period.
Update: 7 Oct 2019
Terry Xu/The Online Citizen made a statement falsely alleging that there was a 'Hep C cover up prior to the GE2015'.
Below is MOH's clarification:
Terry Xu's/The Online Citizen's statement that there was a 'Hep C cover up prior to the GE2015' is false. An Independent Review Committee conducted an objective and critical review of the incident and found no evidence of deliberate delays by SGH or MOH in escalating the Hepatitis C outbreak, let alone a cover up. Public healthcare professionals and MOH officers carry out their duties professionally with patients' best interests in mind. The timeline of key events was disclosed by MOH.

Factually sets things straight:
1. Did the Auditor-General flag that $13 million was missing, as stated in the TRN article?
No, AGO did not indicate in its report that there were missing funds.
TRN's false claim: ""After being flagged for missing $13 million by the Auditor-General, Minister for Culture Grace Fu denied that there is any corruption or fraud involved.""
Actual extract from AGO report: ""AGO's test checks revealed weaknesses such as waivers of contractual provisions involving $13 million without due scrutiny by MCCY.""
MCCY has also reviewed AGO's findings and is satisfied that there is no fraud involved in NGS' waivers of contractual provisions.
2. What did the $13 million in the AGO report relate to then?
The $13 million was primarily waivers of amounts payable for additional time taken by the contractor to complete construction works. NGS had assessed that the requests for additional time were reasonable, considering the scale and complexity of the project. Thus they waived the amounts that the contractor would have needed to pay for the delay.
NGS managed the project according to industry best practices, as advised by the NGS's Project Development Committee which comprised experts from the construction industry.
3. Did Minister Fu say that the ""missing $13 million"" is ""normal""?
No. In her response in Parliament, Minister Fu did not use the word 'normal'. Her response, in full, is as follows:
""The S$13 million) is actually waivers and also for variation orders, which are to be expected for a project that massive that involves two monuments and an extension connecting the two.""
4. What will MCCY and NGS do to avoid this from occurring again in future?
The  NGS  Board  and Audit  Committee,  which  includes  members  of  its  Board with  experience  in  accounting  and  audit  matters,  have  completed  their  review  of NGS'  procurement  policies  and  processes  arising  from  AGO's  findings.  NGS has  implemented  improvements  to  its  systems  and  procedures  accordingly.
MCCY's  fifth  and  final  audit  has  since  resumed  after  being  suspended  due  to the  AGO  audit.   Arising  from  the  AGO  audit  and  MCCY's  final  audit,  MCCY  will  work  with  NGS to  enhance  financial  processes  and  procurement  policies.  This  will  include rectifying  any  issues  identified  from  these  audit  findings. Both  MCCY and  NGS  take  the  proper  use  and  management  of  public  funds seriously,  and will work  together  to  enhance  financial  processes  and  procurement policies.

Falsehood #1
:
The Government is not upfront about how Ministerial salaries are calculated.
Fact
: This is false. The salary structure for Minister's is transparent and set out in a White Paper, which was tabled in Parliament in 2012. You can find the White Paper
here. [PDF, 2.8MB]
The salary norm for an entry-level Minister (i.e., job grade MR4), including bonuses, is $1.1 million a year. This includes fixed and variable pay components which are linked to individual performance and national outcomes.
If the Minister doesn't do well ' and if the economy and other national outcomes do not do well ' he/she may get well below $1.1 million.
Falsehood #2:
The Prime Minister is paid $2.2 million a year as a base salary, excluding bonuses. His annual salary is $4.5 million.
Fact
: This is false. The Prime Minister's total norm salary is set at two times that of an entry level MR4 Minister, i.e., $2.2 million a year. This annual salary includes the monthly pay, 13th month bonus, Annual Variable Component and National Bonus, i.e., it includes bonuses.

2018-08-27,Are more foreigners taking away jobs of Singaporeans?,"Ministry of Manpower responds to this, and other inaccuracies published by the States Times Review.",Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/are-more-foreigners-taking-away-jobs-of-singaporeans/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/a9f50538-f03d-44de-a95e-2f997164101b/mom-workers-cover.png,"A recent article by the States Times Review (STR) made several erroneous claims, following the latest release of employment figures
[1]
by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).
MOM debunks the incorrect claims and clarifies the facts.
1. Are foreigners taking away jobs of Singaporeans?
STR claims:
The Government admitted that more foreigners are taking away jobs of Singaporeans.
A total of 3,000 Singaporeans lost their jobs from March 2018 to June 2018, as the number of unemployed Singaporeans increased from 57,600 to 60,600.
Foreigners gained 11,800 jobs in the same period.
MOM clarifies:
MOM publishes data on local/foreign employment growth on a half yearly basis, with the next release in September 2018.
The most recent release, in March 2018, showed that local employment growth in 2017 was 21,300, while foreign employment growth was
minus
32,000.
An increase in unemployment for Singaporeans:
Cannot be attributed solely to job losses;
Could be due to more Singaporeans entering the job market, or voluntary job leavers looking for new jobs, as the economy picks up;
Must be read with other labour market data such as employment, resignation, re-entry into employment and labour force participation. For example, while the unemployment rate inched up in 2017, local employment growth almost doubled.
2. Do the official unemployment figures omit the numbers of certain groups of people?
STR claims:
The unemployment figures excluded:
married women (whom they dismissed as 'housewives');
Singaporeans on national service duties;
seniors above the retirement age of 65 (whom they dismissed as 'retired');
those who are considered long-term unemployed.
MOM clarifies:
You are considered unemployed if you are:
not working;
actively seeking work; and
available for work
This is regardless of demographic characteristics, including age, gender and marital status.
Hence, 'housewives' and 'retirees' who are looking for and available for work, as well as the long-term unemployed,
are included
in the unemployed figures.
Full-time national servicemen
are not included
because the nature of their NS obligation means they cannot be actively seeking work nor be available for work.
3. Do the employment figures leave out data on income?
STR claims:
Data on income is left out in the Labour Market Advance Release.
Over 80 per cent of working retirees are taking home less than $1,000 a month.
MOM clarifies:
Income data are made public regularly. Data on income from work are released annually in a number of MOM publications. For example, in the full-year advance and final releases of the
Labour Market Report
, and the
Labour Force in Singapore Report
.
In 2017, 24 per cent of employed residents aged 65 and over (including part-timers) had a gross monthly income of less than $1,000, which is lower than the 43 per cent in 2012
Support measures are available. All workers earning lower income get additional support through the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), with older low wage workers getting more.
4. Did the Government doctor the unemployment figures?
STR claims:
The Government did so because it is 'a key component of the ministerial salaries'
MOM clarifies:
The compilation of unemployment statistics in Singapore adheres strictly to international standards set by:
- International Labour Organisation (ILO)
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
IMF regularly monitors observance of the requirements and any discrepancy or non-adherence will be highlighted.
The IMF has never highlighted any doubts about the labour statistics released by Singapore.

A voice recording of a woman alleging that a $200 MediSave amount given by the Government would be taken back if unused within a year, has been making its rounds. She claims that a lady at a polyclinic counter had given her this information, and that her family would always use this MediSave amount when they visited polyclinics, so that they did not need to pay cash.
An article in Lianhe Zaobao about this alleged case is appended:
MediSave top-ups will not be taken back by the Government
The claims made in the clip are not true.
Unused MediSave top-ups will not be taken back by the Government. These will remain in your CPF account, and continue to earn interest.
What can MediSave be used for?
You can use your MediSave monies to pay for things like:
Hospitalisation, day surgery, and approved outpatient treatments
MediShield Life premiums
Other MediSave-approved insurance plans
When your MediSave reaches its account limit (i.e. the Basic Healthcare Sum), any excess will flow over to your CPF Special or Retirement accounts, to help build your retirement savings.
What are the MediSave top-up schemes by the Government?
There are two regular MediSave top-up schemes, namely the GST Voucher scheme and the Pioneer Generation Package. Singaporeans born on or before 31 December 1959, who do not enjoy Pioneer Generation benefits, would have also received MediSave top-ups annually from 2014 to 2018.
Always verify the facts with the relevant authorities
Should members of the public have questions about MediSave use, they may contact the Ministry of Health at 6325-9220.
Details on regular MediSave top-ups can be found on the
MOH website
and the

2018-03-31,Singapore's national reserves: Is the Government excessively prudent?,We need to be ready to deal with unforeseen events and crises.,Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/singapores-national-reserves-is-the-government-excessively-prudent/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/8616896b-dece-4a9e-9140-17c218b79cfc/cbd-buildings-5.jpg,"There have been suggestions that the Government is excessively prudent and that too much investment income is put back into the national reserves. Some have cited the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) general guidance on reserves adequacy, which appear to advocate a less conservative approach than what Singapore is practising.
What is the IMF's guidance on reserves?
IMF's recommendation is meant to cater only for one specific risk: the risk of capital flight. This refers to the risk of a large scale exodus of financial assets from a country, due to a loss of confidence in the national currency. IMF's recommendation does not address other risks.
However, we need to be ready for crises that go beyond capital flight risks
. Singapore is a small and open economy. This means that we will always be vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy and financial markets. We must be prepared to deal with unforeseen events and crises which can have a very significant impact on Singapore.
What were some of the crises we faced in the past?
In 2009, Singapore's economy was severely threatened amidst the Global Financial Crisis. Fortunately, the Government sought the President's approval for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits in Singapore to be backed by the reserves, and to draw on $4.9 billion of reserves to fund two one-off measures to boost the economy.
Beyond preparing for future economic crises, we need to continue to anticipate other forms of crises that may impact Singapore, such as security or health emergencies.
International developments today highlight that the future is ever-changing and uncertain. We can never predict where or when the next crisis will come.
How can we grow our revenues while saving for the future?
Even as we save for future crises, we are still benefitting from the reserves now. Contributions from reserves are already the largest contributor to government revenues today. If we did not have our reserves to generate investment returns to spend from, we would have had to more than double personal income tax, or Goods and Services Tax (GST), to raise the same amount of revenue.
Singapore has a significant financial advantage in being able to tap on the contributions from our reserves for spending, instead of using the money to pay interest on debt.

2018-01-26,Is it true that over 60% of foreign domestic workers here are exploited,"No. In fact, 97% have no issues with their workload and want to continue working here.",Corrections and Clarifications,https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/is-it-true-that-over-60-of-foreign-domestic-workers-here-are-exploited/,https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/35/f951068d-f011-47b6-be1e-e1b9b4cd2e6c/MOM.jpg,"A survey published in Nov 2017 claimed that over 60% of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore were exploited.
The survey, conducted by Research Across Borders (RAB), used a flawed methodology which resulted in biased and skewed outcomes. It made several unsubstantiated claims, of which two examples are appended below.
Claim #1: FDWs made to work excessive hours
Clarification:
The survey depicts an inaccurate picture of the working conditions of FDWs here. It used an overly simplistic interpretation of the International Labour Organisation's indicators of labour exploitation, one of which cites working for more than 12 daily working hours as an indication of excessive working days or hours.
RAB's survey had calculated total working hours based on the reported times of starting work and ending work by FDW respondents. However, this calculation ignored the unique nature of domestic work, where work and personal time in the context of domestic work cannot be easily differentiated. For example, the FDW would have rest time in the day such as when they rest in between chores, and when they take their meals and shower.
It is therefore inaccurate and misleading for RAB to claim that FDWs work excessive hours, based on start and end time of their work days.
Claim #2: FDWs are being isolated and confined
Clarification:
The survey conveniently concludes that FDWs are being isolated and confined if they need their employers' permission to leave the house or return by a certain time on their rest days. This neglects to take into consideration the working and living arrangements of FDWs.
Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, FDWs must stay with their employers at the address stated on their work permits. FDW employers are also responsible for the health, safety and well-being of their FDWs. For this reason, employers would want to be kept aware of their FDWs' plans to leave or return to the household. This does not amount to isolation or confinement.
What is the real picture?
MOM's survey of 1,000 FDWs in 2015 found that 97% were satisfied working here, would continue working here, and had no issues with workload. As at Sep 2017, about 2 in 3 (160,000) FDWs had worked in Singapore for over two years, and about 1 in 2 (110,000) for over four years. As can be seen, the RAB survey painted a misleading picture of the employment of FDWs here.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had highlighted these misinterpretations to RAB researcher Anja Wessels in 2016 when she sought feedback from MOM on her preliminary analysis. Nevertheless, RAB proceeded to publish the inaccurate findings without correcting or addressing these misinterpretations.",2.1088257,4.5004773,2018,2,"Employment (Read: Cost of Living, Foreigners)",Research Across Borders
